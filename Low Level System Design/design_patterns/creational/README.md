As the name suggests, these are being used to Create Objects of a Class.

How the objects are created ?

```java
Car car = new Car();
```

so basically this will call the constructor.

But in big projects you may have bigger object with lots of attributes, 
and also it is possible that you might have a lots of different-2 objects.

Anyway let's see what are the Creational Design Patterns we have.

1. [Singleton](Singleton/README.md)
2. [Factory](Factory/README.md)
3. [Abstract Factory](AbstractFactory/README.md)
4. [Builder](Builder/README.md)
5. [Prototype](Prototype/README.md)

Now out of these 5, you may have used some of them if you are a working
professional.

Anyway, here we are going to see them one by one. So go through the directory
for each design pattern.

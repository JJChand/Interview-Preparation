As the name suggests, these are being used to Create Objects of a Class.

How the objects are created ?
```
Car car = new Car();
```
so basically this will call the constructor.

But in big projects you may have bigger object with lots of attributes 
and also it is possible that you might have a lots of different-2 objects. 

Anyway let's see what are the Creational Design Patterns we have.

1. Singleton
2. Factory
3. Abstract Factory
4. Builder
5. Prototype

Now out of these 5, you may have used some of them if you are a working
professional.

I have used Singleton, Factory and Builder.

Anyway, here we are going to see them one by one. So go through the directory
for each design pattern.

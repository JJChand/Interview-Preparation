### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer:** Let's discuss a problem scenario where we need to find employees in a company who earn more than their managers. We have an Employee table with the columns `id`, `name`, `salary`, and `managerId`. How would you write a query to find such employees?

**Interviewee:** Sure, let's start by understanding the problem. We need to identify employees whose salaries are greater than their managers. To achieve this, we will need to compare each employee’s salary with the salary of their manager using the `managerId` column.

**Interviewer:** Right, that sounds correct. How would you approach this problem initially?

**Interviewee:** For a brute force approach, I would think about joining the Employee table with itself. The idea would be to match each employee with their respective manager and then compare their salaries.

**Interviewer:** That sounds like a feasible approach. Can you write the query and discuss the time and space complexity?

**Interviewee:** Sure! Here’s the SQL query for the brute force approach:

```sql
SELECT E1.name AS Employee
FROM Employee E1
JOIN Employee E2 ON E1.managerId = E2.id
WHERE E1.salary > E2.salary;
```

**Explanation:**
1. We join the Employee table `E1` with itself (`E2`).
2. The join condition `E1.managerId = E2.id` ensures that `E1` is referring to its manager in `E2`.
3. The `WHERE E1.salary > E2.salary` filters the employees who earn more than their managers.

**Interviewer:** That makes sense. Let's discuss the time and space complexity of this approach.

**Interviewee:** 
- **Time Complexity:** 
  - This solution involves a self-join, which typically has a time complexity of `O(n^2)` where `n` is the number of employees. This is because each row in `E1` has to be compared with each row in `E2`.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is `O(n)` for storing the result set, as we are storing a subset of the employees.

**Interviewer:** Good. Can we optimize this approach? Is there any other way to reduce the complexity or make it more efficient?

**Interviewee:** The self-join approach is quite optimal in this context since it allows us to directly compare employee salaries with their managers’ salaries. Given the nature of relational databases and SQL’s capabilities, the self-join is an efficient and straightforward way to accomplish this task.

Here's a diagram to illustrate:

```plaintext
+----------+                                     +----------+
| E1       |                                     | E2       |
+----+-----+                                     +----+-----+
| id | ... |                                     | id | ... |
+----+-----+                                     +----+-----+
|  1 |     |  <--- joining on E1.managerId = E2.id ---> |  3 |
+----+-----+                                     +----+-----+
|  2 |     |                                     |  4 |     |
+----+-----+                                     +----+-----+
.
.
```

In this example, each row in `E1` is joined with the corresponding row in `E2` based on the `managerId`.

**Interviewer:** Excellent. This is a good and optimal approach using the capabilities of SQL. Your explanation and optimization thoughts are clear. Thank you!

**Interviewee:** Thank you!

This concludes our discussion on writing a solution to find employees who earn more than their managers using SQL.
Certainly! Let's write the code for each language provided:

### MySQL

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT E1.name AS Employee
FROM Employee E1
JOIN Employee E2 ON E1.managerId = E2.id
WHERE E1.salary > E2.salary;
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n^2)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

### MS SQL Server

```mssql
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */

SELECT E1.name AS Employee
FROM Employee E1
JOIN Employee E2 ON E1.managerId = E2.id
WHERE E1.salary > E2.salary;
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n^2)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

### Oracle

```oraclesql
/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */

SELECT E1.name AS Employee
FROM Employee E1
JOIN Employee E2 ON E1.managerId = E2.id
WHERE E1.salary > E2.salary;
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n^2)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

### Pandas (Python)

```pythondata
import pandas as pd

def find_employees(employee: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    merged = employee.merge(employee, left_on='managerId', right_on='id', suffixes=('', '_manager'))
    result = merged[merged['salary'] > merged['salary_manager']]
    return result[['name']]

**Time Complexity:** O(n^2) (due to the self-merge operation)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)

### PostgreSQL

```postgresql

### Closing Statement

In our discussion, we addressed the problem of finding employees who earn more than their managers in a company. We started by understanding the structure of the Employee table and identifying a brute force approach using a self-join in SQL. This approach involves joining the Employee table with itself to compare each employee’s salary against their manager's salary. We wrote the query in multiple SQL dialects (MySQL, MS SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL) and also provided an implementation using Python’s Pandas library.

We discussed the time complexity of O(n^2) due to the self-join operation and the space complexity of O(n) for storing the result set. The chosen approach leverages the strengths of relational databases for efficient data retrieval and comparison.

### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer**: Let's discuss a database question. Consider a table called `Customer` which has three columns: `id`, `name`, and `referee_id`. The `id` is the primary key and each row indicates the id of a customer, their name, and the id of the customer who referred them. 

**Interviewee**: Got it. So each row uniquely represents a customer and `referee_id` is the id of another customer who referred them.

**Interviewer**: Correct. The task is to find the names of customers who were not referred by the customer with `id = 2`. The result needs to be returned in any order. 

**Interviewee**: Understood. The `referee_id` will help us filter out the entries. If a customer has `referee_id = 2`, then we don't include them in our result set.

**Interviewer**: Exactly. How would you start solving this problem?

### Initial Thoughts and Brute Force Approach

**Interviewee**: For a brute force approach, I would:

1. Scan through the entire table.
2. For each row, check the `referee_id` field.
3. If `referee_id` is not equal to 2 (and it could also be null), include the name in the result set.

### Brute Force Approach Explanation and Complexity

**Interviewer**: Sounds good. Can you proceed and explain the time and space complexity for this brute force method?

**Interviewee**:
- **Time Complexity**: We need to scan every row in the table which results in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of rows in the table.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity would be O(m), where m is the number of rows that do not have `referee_id = 2`, for storing the result set.

### Optimizing the Approach

**Interviewee**: Let's consider how to optimize this. In SQL-based queries, we can directly use a `SELECT` statement to filter out the unwanted rows. This might be more efficient and offers a clear, concise solution.

We can write a simple SQL query like:
```sql
SELECT name
FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;
```

**Interviewer**: That looks good. Could you explain why this query works?

**Interviewee**:

- The `SELECT` statement extracts the `name` column from the `Customer` table.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the customers. Specifically, `referee_id != 2` eliminates those referred by the customer with `id = 2`.
- We also include the condition `referee_id IS NULL` to ensure customers with no referees are included since their `referee_id` is `NULL`.

**Interviewer**: Great! Can you illustrate this with a diagram?

**Interviewee**: Sure, let's visualize it:

1. Here’s our `Customer` table:

```
+----+------+------------+
| id | name | referee_id |
+----+------+------------+
| 1  | Will | null       |
| 2  | Jane | null       |
| 3  | Alex | 2          |
| 4  | Bill | null       |
| 5  | Zack | 1          |
| 6  | Mark | 2          |
+----+------+------------+
```

2. Applying the SQL query:

```
SELECT name
FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;
```

3. Step-by-step Filtering:

   - Will (referee_id = null) → include
   - Jane (referee_id = null) → include
   - Alex (referee_id = 2) → exclude
   - Bill (referee_id = null) → include
   - Zack (referee_id = 1) → include
   - Mark (referee_id = 2) → exclude

4. Result:

```
+------+
| name |
+------+
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |
+------+
```

**Interviewer**: Nicely explained and well-illustrated! This query certainly presents a more efficient solution.

**Interviewee**: Thank you! Glad to hear that.



Sure, here is the code for each language wrapped in the appropriate methods provided.

### MySQL

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT name
FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Customer` table, as the query scans each row exactly once.

**Space Complexity**: O(m), where m is the number of rows that do not have `referee_id = 2`, for storing the result set.

### MS SQL Server

```mssql
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */

SELECT name
FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Customer` table, as the query scans each row exactly once.

**Space Complexity**: O(m), where m is the number of rows that do not have `referee_id = 2`, for storing the result set.

### Oracle

```oraclesql
/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */

SELECT name
FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Customer` table, as the query scans each row exactly once.

**Space Complexity**: O(m), where m is the number of rows that do not have `referee_id = 2`, for storing the result set.

### Pandas (Python)

```pythondata
import pandas as pd

def find_customer_referee(customer: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    result = customer[(customer['referee_id'] != 2) | (customer['referee_id'].isnull())]
    return result[['name']]
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `customer` DataFrame, as the filtering operation scans each row exactly once.

**Space Complexity**: O(m), where m is the number of rows that do not have `referee_id = 2`, for storing the result DataFrame.

### PostgreSQL

```postgresql
-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below

SELECT name
FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the `Customer` table, as the query scans each row exactly once.

**Space Complexity**: O(m), where m is the number of rows that do not have `referee_id = 2`, for storing the result set.

These solutions across different languages and SQL variants follow the same logic and thus share similar time and space complexities.


### Closing Statement

We have successfully discussed and solved the problem of finding customers who are not referred by the customer with `id = 2` in a database table. We reviewed an initial brute force approach to understand the basics and then optimized it using SQL queries and Pandas DataFrame techniques for better performance. The optimized solutions are efficient, with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(m). These solutions demonstrate how SQL and data manipulation libraries like Pandas can be used effectively for such filtering operations in a database or data frame. This exercise also highlights the importance of thinking through the problem, considering edge cases, and choosing the right tools for optimization.

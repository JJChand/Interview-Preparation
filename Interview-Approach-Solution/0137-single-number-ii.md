### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer:** Let's discuss a problem where you have an integer array `nums` where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Your task is to find this unique element and return it. The solution must have linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space. How would you approach this problem?

**Interviewee:** Okay, I understand the problem. One straightforward approach could be to use a hash map to keep track of the frequency of each element, but that would require extra space for the hash map. Since we need a solution with constant space, we need to think of a different way.

**Interviewer:** That's a good starting point. Can you discuss how a brute force approach might look like?

**Interviewee:** Sure. A brute force approach would involve checking the frequency of each element. We could use two nested loops to count the occurrences of each element. So, for each element, we would loop through the array to count how many times that element appears. This approach would have a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) and a space complexity of \(O(1)\), which isn't optimal according to the problem constraints.

### Brute Force Approach

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\)
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\)

**Interviewer:** You're right, the brute force approach is not efficient. Can you think of a way to optimize it?

**Interviewee:** We need to keep track of the counts of bits across the array without extra space. One efficient way is to use bitwise operators. We can represent each bit position with two variables and update these variables for each number in the array.

### Optimized Approach Using Bitwise Operations

**Interviewee:** We can use two variables `ones` and `twos` to achieve the required result. The idea is to store the bits that appear once and twice, respectively. Here's how it can be done:

1. Initialize `ones` and `twos` to 0.
2. For each number in the array, update `ones` and `twos` based on the current number.
3. Finally, `ones` will hold the unique number that appears exactly once.

Here's the detailed breakdown:
- `ones ^= number`: Adds the bits of `number` to `ones` if they aren't already in `twos`.
- `twos |= ones & number`: Adds the bits of `number` to `twos` if they are currently in `ones`.
- `mask = ~(ones & twos)`: Creates a mask to remove bits that appeared three times.
- `ones &= mask`: Removes the bits that appeared three times from `ones`.
- `twos &= mask`: Removes the bits that appeared three times from `twos`.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) - We iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) - We only use a few extra variables.

### Optimized Code

```python
def singleNumber(nums):
    ones, twos = 0, 0
    for num in nums:
        ones = (ones ^ num) & ~twos
        twos = (twos ^ num) & ~ones
    return ones
```

### Diagram for Bitwise Operation

Imagine the number `num` has bit values like this: `num = 0011`. We will use `ones` and `twos` variables to track bit counts. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step diagram:

- **Initial State:**
  - `ones = 0000`
  - `twos = 0000`

- **After Processing first 0011:**
  - `ones = (0000 ^ 0011) & ~(0000) = 0011`
  - `twos = (0000 ^ 0011) & ~(0011) = 0000`

- **After Processing second 0011:**
  - `ones = (0011 ^ 0011) & ~(0000) = 0000`
  - `twos = (0000 ^ 0011) & ~(0000) = 0011`

- **After Processing third 0011:**
  - `ones = (0000 ^ 0011) & ~(0011) = 0000`
  - `twos = (0011 ^ 0011) & ~(0000) = 0000`

The bits in `ones` and `twos` that have appeared three times will be cleared. When the unique number appears, it will remain in `ones`.

**Interviewer:** Excellent! This bitwise approach is both efficient and meets the problem constraints. Thank you for the detailed explanation and solution.

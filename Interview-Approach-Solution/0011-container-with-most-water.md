### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer:** Let's discuss a problem about finding the maximum amount of water that can be contained between two vertical lines on an array. You are given an integer array, `height`, of length `n` where `n` denotes the number of vertical lines. The `i-th` line has endpoints `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`. Your task is to find two lines such that, together with the x-axis, they form a container that can store the maximum amount of water. Are you clear on the problem statement?

**Interviewee:** Yes, I understand. So, essentially, I need to identify two lines that maximize the area between them and the x-axis. 

**Interviewer:** That's correct! How would you approach solving this problem?

### Initial Thoughts: Brute Force Approach

**Interviewee:** My initial thought would be a brute force approach. We could consider every possible pair of lines and calculate the area between them. The area between lines at index `i` and `j` is determined by the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = (j - i) \times \min(\text{height}[i], \text{height}[j]) \]
We could iterate over all pairs of lines using nested loops and track the maximum area found.

### Brute Force Approach

1. **Initialize a variable `max_area` to 0.**
2. **Use two nested loops:**
   - Outer loop with `i` ranging from `0` to `n-2`.
   - Inner loop with `j` ranging from `i+1` to `n-1`.
3. **Calculate the area for each pair `(i, j)` using the formula** \((j - i) \times \min(\text{height}[i], \text{height}[j])\).
4. **Update `max_area` if the calculated area is larger.**
5. **Return `max_area`.**

### Complexity Analysis of Brute Force Approach

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\) because we are using two nested loops to go through all possible pairs of lines.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) as we are only using a few extra variables for calculation.

### Interviewer:** Can you think of a more efficient method, considering the constraints?

### Optimized Approach: Two-Pointer Technique

**Interviewee:** To optimize, we can use the two-pointer technique. By initializing two pointers, one at the beginning (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of the array, we can calculate areas and move the pointers towards each other based on their heights.

1. **Initialize two pointers:** `left = 0` and `right = n - 1`.
2. **Initialize `max_area` to 0.**
3. **While `left < right`:**
   - Calculate the area \((\text{right} - \text{left}) \times \min(\text{height}[\text{left}], \text{height}[\text{right}])\).
   - Update `max_area` if the calculated area is larger.
   - Move the pointer that points to the shorter line inward:
     - If `height[left] < height[right]`, increment `left`.
     - Else, decrement `right`.
4. **Return `max_area`.**

### Complexity Analysis of Optimized Approach

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) because each pointer only traverses the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) as we are only using a few extra variables for calculation.

### Visual Illustration

Here is a visual summary of how the two-pointer technique works:

```
Initial State:
    left  -------------------------------->  right
    |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |
  height: [ 1,        8,       6,       2,       5,       4,       8,       3,       7]
             ^                                                             ^

Step 1:
  Calculate area with left=0 and right=8:
  area = (8 - 0) * min(1, 7) = 8 * 1 = 8
  Since height[left] < height[right], increment left.

Updated State:
    left  -------------------------------->  right
            |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |
  height: [ 1,        8,       6,       2,       5,       4,       8,       3,       7]
             ^                                                         ^

... Continue similarly until left meets right.
```

### Closing Statement

In our discussion, we tackled the problem of finding the maximum area of water a container can store formed by two vertical lines on an array. We started with a brute force approach, which has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) and concluded that it wasn't efficient for larger inputs. Moving on, we optimized our solution using the two-pointer technique, reducing the time complexity to \(O(n)\) while maintaining a space complexity of \(O(1)\). This approach allowed us to efficiently solve the problem within the constraints provided.

We demonstrated implementations across several programming languages, ensuring the solution is both versatile and efficient regardless of the platform used. These examples should offer a clear understanding of how to approach such problems and apply the two-pointer technique effectively.

Understanding and implementing optimized algorithms like this is critical for coding interviews and real-world applications where performance and efficiency are key.

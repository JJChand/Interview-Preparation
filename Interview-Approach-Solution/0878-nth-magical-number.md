### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer:** Let's go through the problem statement together. We have to find the nth magical number where a number is considered magical if it's divisible by either `a` or `b`. How would you tackle this problem?

**Interviewee:** To start, I would think about the problem in terms of generating numbers that are divisible by either `a` or `b` and identifying the nth such number. 

**Interviewer:** That sounds like a good plan. Can you describe a brute force approach to solve this problem?

**Interviewee:** Sure. A brute force approach would involve generating numbers sequentially and checking if each number is divisible by either `a` or `b`. If it is, we count it as a magical number, and we keep going until we find the nth magical number.

**Interviewer:** That makes sense. Could you outline the steps for this brute force approach?

**Interviewee:**
1. Initialize a counter to keep track of how many magical numbers we've found.
2. Iterate over numbers starting from 1.
3. For each number, check if it is divisible by `a` or `b`.
4. If it is, increment the counter.
5. Stop when the counter reaches `n` and return the current number as the nth magical number.

**Interviewer:** What are the time and space complexities of this brute force approach?

**Interviewee:** 
- **Time Complexity:** In the worst case, we might need to check up to `n * max(a, b)` numbers, which would be quite large given the constraints. This approach can be O(n * max(a, b)), making it very inefficient.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(1) because we are only using a few variables for counting and checking divisibility.

**Interviewer:** Good analysis. This approach seems inefficient given the constraints. Can you think of a more efficient way to solve the problem?

**Interviewee:** Yes, we can approach it using a more optimized method involving binary search. 

### Optimized Approach using Binary Search

**Interviewee:** We know that the nth magical number lies between 1 and `n * min(a, b)`. We can use binary search to find this number efficiently.

**Steps:**
1. Define `low` as 1 and `high` as `n * min(a, b)`.
2. Use binary search between `low` and `high` to find the smallest number `x` such that there are at least `n` magical numbers less than or equal to `x`.
3. For a midpoint `mid`, count how many numbers less than or equal to `mid` are magical using the formula: `mid // a + mid // b - mid // lcm(a, b)`.
4. Adjust the search range based on the count from step 3 until you converge to the correct number.

Here, `lcm(a, b)` is the least common multiple of `a` and `b`, which accounts for the numbers divisible by both `a` and `b`.

### Code Implementation

```python
def nthMagicalNumber(n, a, b):
    import math
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    def lcm(x, y):
        return x * (y // math.gcd(x, y))
    
    L = lcm(a, b)
    
    low, high = 1, n * min(a, b)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if mid // a + mid // b - mid // L < n:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    
    return low % MOD
```

### Explanation with Diagram

Consider `a = 2` and `b = 3`. Here's a visual explanation of how binary search narrows down the range:

1. Initially, search range is from 1 to `n * min(2, 3) = n * 2`.
2. Calculate `mid`, and determine how many magical numbers (numbers divisible by 2 or 3) are ≤ `mid`.
3. Adjust `low` and `high` based on the count until the correct nth magical number is found.

For `n = 4`, `a = 2`, and `b = 3`, the values are:
- When `low = 1` and `high = 8`, mid = 4, magical numbers ≤ 4 are (2, 3, 4) [count is 3]
- Increase `low` to 5.
- When `low = 5` and `high = 8`, mid = 6, magical numbers ≤ 6 are (2, 3, 4, 6) [count is 4]
- Adjust `high` to 6 because the count fulfills the requirement.

Thus, the 4th magical number is 6, as confirmed in the example.

**Interviewer:** This makes sense, and the explanation clears up the logic behind binary search. The optimized approach is much more efficient given the constraints. Great job!

### Closing Statement

Thank you for the insightful discussion on finding the nth magical number. We've explored a brute force approach for completeness but quickly identified its inefficiencies given the problem's constraints. By leveraging binary search and understanding the properties of lower common multiples (LCM), we developed an optimized solution suitable for large inputs, ensuring efficient computation within acceptable time limits.

We've translated our optimized approach to various programming languages, emphasizing the versatility and universal applicability of this algorithm. The incorporation of gcd and binary search techniques allows for a robust solution with logarithmic time complexity and constant space complexity.

This type of problem-solving is not only critical for technical interviews but also essential in practical scenarios where efficiency and performance matter. Mastering these techniques can significantly enhance your ability to tackle complex algorithmic challenges effectively.

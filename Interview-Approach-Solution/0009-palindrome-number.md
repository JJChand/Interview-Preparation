### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion:

**Interviewer:** Let's discuss a question where we need to check whether a given integer `x` is a palindrome or not. The integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is a palindrome, but -121 is not. How would you approach this problem?

**Interviewee:** To start with, the most straightforward approach that comes to mind is to convert the integer into a string. Once we have the string, we can easily check if it reads the same backward as forward. 

**Interviewer:** That sounds like a good starting point. Can you walk me through how you would implement this brute force solution and then discuss its time and space complexity?

### Initial Thought: Brute Force Approach

**Interviewee:** Sure! Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the brute force approach:

1. **Convert the integer to a string.**
2. **Reverse the string.**
3. **Check if the original string is equal to the reversed string:**
   - If they are equal, then the integer is a palindrome.
   - Otherwise, it is not.

Here's how the code might look:

```python
def is_palindrome(x):
    s = str(x)  # Step 1: Convert integer to string
    return s == s[::-1]  # Step 2 and 3: Reverse the string and compare
```

**Interviewer:** Great! Let's discuss the time and space complexity of this approach.

**Interviewee:** 

- **Time Complexity:** Converting the integer to a string takes O(n) time, where n is the number of digits. Reversing the string also takes O(n) time. Overall, the time complexity is O(n).
- **Space Complexity:** Storing the string and its reverse requires O(n) space, so the space complexity is O(n).

**Interviewer:** That's correct. Now, can we optimize this further, especially considering the follow-up which asks if this can be solved without converting the integer to a string?

### Optimized Approach

**Interviewee:** Yes, we can solve this without converting the integer to a string by using a numerical approach. Here’s how we can do it:

1. **Handle Special Cases:** If `x` is negative, it is not a palindrome.
2. **Reconstruct the Reverse of the Integer:** We can do this by extracting the digits from the end one by one and appending them to build the reverse of the integer.
3. **Compare the Original Integer with the Reversed Integer:** If they are the same, it's a palindrome.

Here's the code for this optimized solution:

```python
def is_palindrome(x):
    if x < 0:
        return False
    
    original = x
    reverse = 0
    
    while x > 0:
        digit = x % 10
        reverse = reverse * 10 + digit
        x //= 10
    
    return original == reverse
```

**Interviewer:** That looks good. Let's discuss the time and space complexity of this optimized solution.

### Time and Space Complexity:

**Time Complexity:**
- We are essentially iterating through each digit of the number once, so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of digits in the integer.

**Space Complexity:**
- We are using a few extra variables to store the reverse number and other temporary values. The space complexity is O(1) because we are not using extra space that scales with the input size.

**Interviewer:** Excellent explanation. Could you now provide a visual representation of how the optimized algorithm works?

### Visual Representation:

Let’s take the example `x = 121` to visualize the process:

1. Original number: `121`
2. Initialize `reverse = 0`
3. Iteration steps:

```
Step 1:
digit = 121 % 10 = 1
reverse = 0 * 10 + 1 = 1
x = 121 // 10 = 12

Step 2:
digit = 12 % 10 = 2
reverse = 1 * 10 + 2 = 12
x = 12 // 10 = 1

Step 3:
digit = 1 % 10 = 1
reverse = 12 * 10 + 1 = 121
x = 1 // 10 = 0
```

4. At this point, we compare the original (`121`) with `reverse` (`121`), and they are equal.

Here’s a simple diagram to illustrate:

```
Original:         121
Reverse steps:
1. Reverse = 1     -> 1 from 1     
2. Reverse = 12    -> 12 from 2
3. Reverse = 121   -> 121 from 1

Original == Reverse -> 121 == 121
```

### Closing Statement

Thank you for the comprehensive discussion on checking if an integer is a palindrome. We explored an initial brute-force approach that leveraged string conversion and then optimized it with a more efficient numerical solution. We implemented the optimized approach across various programming languages, maintaining both time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1), providing robust and efficient solutions.

This exercise has not only strengthened our understanding of basic palindrome logic but also emphasized the importance of optimizing algorithms for better performance.

### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer:** Let's start with understanding the problem. You need to find the high earners in each department, where a high earner is defined as an employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that department. Does that make sense?

**Interviewee:** Yes, it does. Basically, we need to group employees by their departments and then identify the top three unique salaries within each department. From that, we need to retrieve the employees who have those top salaries.

**Interviewer:** Exactly. Let's start by discussing a brute force approach to solve this problem. What comes to your mind?

### Brute Force Approach

**Interviewee:** The brute force approach would involve a few steps:

1. **Join the `Employee` and `Department` tables** on the `departmentId` to get a combined dataset.
2. **Group by** `departmentId` and for each department:
   - Extract the salaries and sort them in descending order to find the top three unique salaries.
   - Filter the employees who have these top three unique salaries.
3. Return the results with the required columns.

**Interviewer:** That makes sense. What do you think about the time and space complexity of this brute force approach?

**Interviewee:**

### Time and Space Complexity of Brute Force Approach

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Joining the two tables typically takes O(N) assuming linear scans, where N is the number of rows in the `Employee` table.
  - Grouping employees by department and sorting salaries within each group would be the most time-consuming part. If we have M departments and each department has on average K employees:
    - Grouping: O(N)
    - Sorting: M * O(K log K), where K represents the size of the department.
  - Overall time complexity is O(N + M*K log K).

- **Space Complexity:**
  - Storing the combined dataset: O(N)
  - Temporary storage for grouping and sorting: O(N)
  - Overall space complexity is O(N).

**Interviewer:** Now, let's see if we can optimize this approach further. 

### Optimized Approach

**Interviewee:** We can use SQL window functions to make this more efficient. Specifically, the `DENSE_RANK` function will help us rank the salaries within each department.

Here is the optimized SQL query:

```sql
WITH RankedSalaries AS (
    SELECT
        d.name AS Department,
        e.name AS Employee,
        e.salary,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY e.departmentId ORDER BY e.salary DESC) AS salary_rank
    FROM
        Employee e
    JOIN
        Department d ON e.departmentId = d.id
)
SELECT
    Department,
    Employee,
    salary
FROM
    RankedSalaries
WHERE
    salary_rank <= 3;
```

### Explanation with Diagram

The optimization involves:

1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)** `RankedSalaries` to compute the rank of salaries within each department.
2. Using `DENSE_RANK()` to assign ranks based on salary within each department (partitioning by `departmentId` and ordering by `salary` in descending order).
3. Filtering the results of the CTE to include only those rows where `salary_rank` is less than or equal to 3.

**Diagram:**

Here is a brief diagram to illustrate how the DENSE_RANK function works:

```
Department | Employee | Salary | DENSE_RANK
-------------------------------------------
IT         | Max      | 90000  | 1
IT         | Joe      | 85000  | 2
IT         | Randy    | 85000  | 2
IT         | Will     | 70000  | 3
-------------------------------------------
Sales      | Henry    | 80000  | 1
Sales      | Sam      | 60000  | 2
-------------------------------------------
```

DENSE_RANK() assigns the same rank to equal values and increments by one for the next unique value. Thus, we only need to filter by rank <= 3 to get the top three unique salaries in each department.

### Time and Space Complexity of Optimized Approach

**Time Complexity:**
- The `DENSE_RANK()` function along with `PARTITION BY` can be computed in linear time for the entire table, O(N).
- The final filtering step is also O(N).
- Overall, the time complexity would be O(N), which is a significant improvement over the brute force approach.

**Space Complexity:**
- The CTE and rank calculation will require O(N) space to store the intermediate results.
- Thus, the space complexity remains O(N).

**Interviewer:** Excellent! This approach is efficient and leverages SQL window functions effectively. Well done.
Sure, I can provide the code snippets for each language with explanations for time and space complexity.

### Closing Statement

In this discussion, we tackled the problem of identifying high earners in each department based on their salaries. We began by outlining a brute force approach and analyzing its time and space complexity. We then optimized the solution using SQL window functions and demonstrated how it could be implemented efficiently in various SQL dialects and Pandas DataFrame operations. This optimized approach significantly improved both the time and space complexity, making it suitable for large datasets. It is crucial to understand different strategies and optimizations when dealing with complex queries and large datasets, as such knowledge is invaluable in database management and data analysis.

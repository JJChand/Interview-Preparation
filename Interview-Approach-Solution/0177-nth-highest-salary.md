### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer**: Let's discuss a SQL problem. We have an `Employee` table with two columns, `id` and `salary`. The task is to find the n-th highest salary from this table. If there's no n-th highest salary, the result should be `null`. To clear things up, you can refer to these examples:

1. Given the Employee table:
    ```
    +----+--------+
    | id | salary |
    +----+--------+
    | 1  | 100    |
    | 2  | 200    |
    | 3  | 300    |
    +----+--------+
    ```
    If `n = 2`, the output should be `200`.

2. Given the Employee table:
    ```
    +----+--------+
    | id | salary |
    +----+--------+
    | 1  | 100    |
    +----+--------+
    ```
    If `n = 2`, the output should be `null`.

How would you approach this problem?

**Interviewee**: Okay, let's start by understanding the requirements and constraints of the problem. We need to find the n-th highest salary in the `Employee` table.

### Initial Thoughts

**Interviewee**: My initial thought is to consider a brute force approach where we could:
1. Sort the salaries in descending order.
2. Retrieve the n-th salary from this sorted list.

### Brute Force Approach

**Interviewee**: Here's how we can achieve this with a brute force approach in SQL:
1. First, we order the salaries in descending order.
2. Then we use the SQL `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses to retrieve the n-th highest salary.

Let's write a SQL query for this:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT salary
FROM Employee
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET n-1;
```

This query sorts the distinct salaries in descending order and then skips the first `n-1` records to get the n-th highest salary. If the n-th highest salary does not exist, it will return an empty result.

### Time and Space Complexity

**Interviewee**:
- **Time Complexity**: Sorting the salaries takes `O(m log m)` where `m` is the number of employees. The `OFFSET` and `LIMIT` operations are `O(n)`, making the overall complexity roughly `O(m log m)`.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(m)` due to the storage of sorted results.

### Optimization with Efficient Data Structures

**Interviewee**: We can optimize this further using Window Functions which are more efficient in handling such queries.

```sql
WITH salary_rank AS (
  SELECT salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as rank
  FROM Employee
)
SELECT salary
FROM salary_rank
WHERE rank = n;
```

This query uses `DENSE_RANK()` to assign ranks to salaries in descending order. Then it retrieves the salary with the specified rank `n`.

### Time and Space Complexity of Optimized Approach

**Interviewee**:
- **Time Complexity**: The use of `DENSE_RANK()` and a window function has a complexity of `O(m)`, making it more efficient compared to sorting.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity remains `O(m)` due to the storage of intermediate ranked results.

Here's a visualization:

1. **Original Table**:
    ```
    +----+--------+
    | id | salary |
    +----+--------+
    | 1  | 100    |
    | 2  | 200    |
    | 3  | 300    |
    +----+--------+
    ```

2. **Ranked Results using `DENSE_RANK()`**:
    ```
    +--------+------+
    | salary | rank |
    +--------+------+
    | 300    | 1    |
    | 200    | 2    |
    | 100    | 3    |
    +--------+------+
    ```

3. **Final Query**: 
    ```sql
    SELECT salary
    FROM salary_rank
    WHERE rank = 2;
    ```
    Result:
    ```
    +--------+
    | salary |
    +--------+
    | 200    |
    +--------+
    ```

**Interviewer**: Excellent! You've walked through a brute-force approach, analyzed complexities, and proposed an optimized solution. Your clear explanation and SQL knowledge are impressive.
Sure, I'll provide the code snippets for each language using the optimized window function approach discussed earlier. I'll also add comments on time and space complexity for each approach.

### MySQL
```mysql
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
    RETURN (
        -- Time Complexity: O(m) for DENSE_RANK and ordering
        -- Space Complexity: O(m) for intermediate results
        WITH salary_rank AS (
            SELECT salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as rnk
            FROM Employee
        )
        SELECT salary
        FROM salary_rank
        WHERE rnk = N
    );
END
```

### MS SQL Server
```mssql
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(@N INT) RETURNS INT AS
BEGIN
    RETURN (
        -- Time Complexity: O(m) for DENSE_RANK and ordering
        -- Space Complexity: O(m) for intermediate results
        WITH salary_rank AS (
            SELECT salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as rnk
            FROM Employee
        )
        SELECT salary
        FROM salary_rank
        WHERE rnk = @N
    );
END
```

### Oracle
```oraclesql
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N IN NUMBER) RETURN NUMBER IS
    result NUMBER;
BEGIN
    -- Time Complexity: O(m) for DENSE_RANK and ordering
    -- Space Complexity: O(m) for intermediate results
    SELECT salary INTO result
    FROM (
        SELECT salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as rnk
        FROM Employee
    )
    WHERE rnk = N;
    
    RETURN result;
END;
```

### Python (Pandas)
```pythondata
import pandas as pd

def nth_highest_salary(employee: pd.DataFrame, N: int) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Time Complexity: O(m log m) due to sorting
    # Space Complexity: O(m) due to storage of sorted results
    result = (
        employee['salary']
        .drop_duplicates()
        .sort_values(ascending=False)
        .reset_index(drop=True)
    )
    
    # Adjust for zero-based index
    if N <= len(result):
        return result.iloc[N-1]
    else:
        return None
```

### PostgreSQL
```postgresql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION NthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS TABLE (Salary INT) AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY (
    -- Time Complexity: O(m) for DENSE_RANK and ordering
    -- Space Complexity: O(m) for intermediate results
    WITH salary_rank AS (
        SELECT salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as rnk
        FROM Employee
    )
    SELECT salary
    FROM salary_rank
    WHERE rnk = N
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

These implementations efficiently compute the n-th highest salary and handle edge cases where the n-th highest salary does not exist. The use of window functions or sorting ensures that the approach is optimized in comparison with brute force methods.


### Closing Statement

Great job on walking through the steps to solve the problem of finding the n-th highest salary from the `Employee` table. You effectively explained the brute force approach and its limitations, and then demonstrated a more optimized solution using window functions in SQL and sorting in Pandas. You also outlined the time and space complexities, providing a clear understanding of the performance implications of each solution.

Here's a summary of the solutions:
- **Brute Force Approach**: Sorting salaries and using offset/limit.
- **Optimized Approach**: Using `DENSE_RANK()` window function to rank salaries and retrieve the n-th highest salary more efficiently.

These implementations in SQL languages (MySQL, MS SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL) and Python with Pandas provide a comprehensive toolkit for tackling similar problems in different environments.

### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer:** Let's discuss the problem where you have `n` coins and need to build a staircase out of them. Each row `i` should contain exactly `i` coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete. Your task is to find the number of complete rows. For instance, if you have `5` coins, you can form 2 complete rows with 3 coins used and one incomplete row with the remaining 2 coins. Any initial thoughts on how you might approach this problem?

**Interviewee:** Initially, we could tackle the problem with a brute force approach. We can keep adding rows starting from the first row and count how many complete rows we can form till we run out of coins. Does that sound reasonable?

**Interviewer:** Certainly, let's dig into the brute force method first. How would you outline your approach and then, can you discuss the time and space complexity?

### Brute Force Approach

**Interviewee:** Here's how the brute force approach would go:
1. Start with the first row.
2. For each row `i`, check if there are at least `i` coins left.
3. Deduct `i` coins from `n` and move to the next row.
4. Continue this until you can no longer form a complete row.

Let's implement this by using a simple loop.

```python
def arrangeCoins(n):
    row = 0
    while n >= row + 1:
        row += 1
        n -= row
    return row
```

**Interviewer:** That seems straightforward. Can you now explain the time and space complexity of this approach?

**Interviewee:**

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is O(k) where `k` is the number of complete rows. In the worst case, this is approximately O(âˆšn) since the sum of the first k natural numbers is `k(k+1)/2`, which is around `n`.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(1) as no extra space is required, aside from a few variables.

**Interviewer:** That sounds good. Is there a way to optimize this approach further?

**Interviewee:** Yes, we can optimize this. Let's switch to a binary search approach since the sum of the first `k` rows forms a triangular number equation `k(k+1)/2`. We can use binary search to find the maximum `k` such that `(k*(k+1))/2` is less than or equal to `n`.

### Optimized Approach using Binary Search

Here's an optimized approach using binary search:

```python
def arrangeCoins(n):
    low, high = 0, n
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        curr_sum = mid * (mid + 1) // 2
        if curr_sum == n:
            return mid
        elif curr_sum < n:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return high
```

**Interviewer:** This seems efficient. Could you explain its time and space complexity?

**Interviewee:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(log n) due to the binary search.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as only a few variables are used.

### Diagram for Explanation

**Interviewee:** To make it clearer, let's consider a graphical explanation:

```
       *
      * *
     * * *
    * * * *   <- "n" coins
```

1. This visual shows a conceptual staircase.
2. We start with 1 coin in the first row, 2 in the second, 3 in the third, and so forth.
3. For `n = 8`, our binary search will determine the maximum complete rows by evaluating these triangular sums and adjusting the search boundaries.

```
   low = 0, high = 8
   mid = (0 + 8) // 2 = 4
   curr_sum = 4 * (4 + 1) // 2 = 10, which is > 8
   new high = 4 - 1 = 3

   mid = (0 + 3) // 2 = 1
   curr_sum = 1 * (1 + 1) // 2 = 1, which is < 8
   new low = 1 + 1 = 2

   mid = (2 + 3) // 2 = 2
   curr_sum = 2 * (2 + 1) // 2 = 3, which is < 8
   new low = 2 + 1 = 3

   mid = (3 + 3) // 2 = 3
   curr_sum = 3 * (3 + 1) // 2 = 6, which is < 8
   new low = 3 + 1 = 4

Final result is high = 3
```

- **Time Complexity:** O(log n) due to the binary search.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as the space used is constant regardless of the input size.


### Closing Statement

In this discussion, we tackled the problem of determining the number of complete rows that can be formed with `n` coins arranged in a staircase fashion. Initially, we considered a brute force approach which, while straightforward, was not optimal in terms of time complexity. We then optimized the solution using a binary search method, which significantly reduced the time complexity to O(log n). Throughout our discussion, we implemented this optimized solution in various programming languages, ensuring a consistent and efficient approach across different environments.

By leveraging binary search, we were able to balance efficiency with simplicity, making the solution not only perform well but also easy to understand. This approach ensures that our solution is scalable even for large values of `n`.

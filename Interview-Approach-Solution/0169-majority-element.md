### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer:** Let's discuss a common problem you might encounter. Given an array `nums` of size `n`, you need to return the majority element. The majority element is defined as the element that appears more than `floor(n / 2)` times. Assume that a majority element always exists in the array.

**Interviewee:** Understood. So the majority element is the one that appears more than half the time in the array. For example, in the array `[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`, the majority element is `2` because it appears 4 out of 7 times, which is more than `floor(7 / 2) = 3`.

**Interviewer:** Exactly. Let's start by discussing a brute force approach to solve this problem.

**Interviewee:** Sure. A brute force approach would involve counting the occurrences of each element and then determining which element has the highest count that meets the majority requirement.

**Interviewer:** How would you implement that?

**Interviewee:** We can use a hash map to store the count of each element. We will iterate through the array and update the hash map with the count of each element. After populating the hash map, we can iterate through the map to find the element with the highest count.

### Brute Force Approach

1. **Initialize** an empty hash map to keep track of counts.
2. **Iterate** through the array `nums`, for each element:
   - If the element is already in the hash map, increment its count.
   - Otherwise, add the element to the hash map and set its count to 1.
3. **Find** the element in the hash map with a count greater than `n / 2`.
4. **Return** that element.

**Interviewer:** That sounds good. Can you explain the time and space complexity of this approach?

**Interviewee:**
- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is \(O(n)\) for iterating through the array to populate the hash map, and another \(O(n)\) to iterate through the hash map to find the majority element. So, overall the time complexity is \(O(n)\).
- **Space Complexity:** We are using a hash map to store the counts of each element, which in the worst case would need \(O(n)\) additional space.

### Code for Brute Force Approach

```python
def majorityElement(nums):
    count_map = {}
    n = len(nums)
    
    for num in nums:
        if num in count_map:
            count_map[num] += 1
        else:
            count_map[num] = 1
            
    for key, value in count_map.items():
        if value > n // 2:
            return key
```

**Interviewer:** That is a solid explanation. Now, can you think of a way to optimize the space complexity?

**Interviewee:** Yes, there's a more efficient algorithm called the **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm** which can solve this problem in \(O(n)\) time and \(O(1)\) space.

**Interviewer:** That's great! Can you explain how the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm works?

### Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm

**Interviewee:**
1. **Initialize** two variables: `candidate` and `count`. Set `candidate` to `None` and `count` to 0.
2. **Iterate** through the array:
   - If `count` is 0, set `candidate` to the current element.
   - If the current element is the same as `candidate`, increment `count` by 1.
   - If the current element is different from `candidate`, decrement `count` by 1.
3. **The candidate at the end of the iteration will be the majority element.**
   
**Diagram to illustrate:**

Let's take the array `[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`:

- Initialize: `candidate = None`, `count = 0`
- Iteration 1: `candidate = 2`, `count = 1`
- Iteration 2: `candidate = 2`, `count = 2`
- Iteration 3: `count = 1` (since current element is 1)
- Iteration 4: `count = 0`
- Iteration 5: `candidate = 1`, `count = 1`
- Iteration 6: `count = 0`
- Iteration 7: `candidate = 2`, `count = 1`
- Iteration 8: `candidate = 2`, `count = 2`
- The final candidate is `2`.

### Code for Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm

```python
def majorityElement(nums):
    candidate = None
    count = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        if count == 0:
            candidate = num
        count += (1 if num == candidate else -1)
    
    return candidate
```

**Interviewer:** Excellent explanation and the diagram helps a lot in understanding the steps clearly. The Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm is indeed a very efficient approach for this problem.

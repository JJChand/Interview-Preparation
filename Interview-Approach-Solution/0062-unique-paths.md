### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion:

**Interviewer:** Let's discuss a problem involving a robot on an \(m \times n\) grid. The robot starts at the top-left corner (\(grid[0][0]\)) and aims to reach the bottom-right corner (\(grid[m-1][n-1]\)). The robot can only move right or down at any point in time. You need to find the number of unique paths the robot can take to get from the top-left to the bottom-right. Given that \(m\) and \(n\) can be up to 100, how would you approach this problem?

**Interviewee:** To find the number of unique paths, we need to consider all possible right and down movements. The goal is essentially a combinatorial problem where each movement is a choice between moving down or right.

### Initial Thoughts on the Brute Force Approach:

**Interviewer:** What would a brute force solution look like?

**Interviewee:** A brute force solution would involve recursively exploring all possible paths from the start to the end. We can use a recursive function to move right or down and accumulate the count of paths that reach the bottom-right corner.

**Interviewer:** Can you explain how the recursive function would work?

**Interviewee:** Sure. The recursive function `countPaths(i, j)` would:
1. Return 1 if `i == m-1` and `j == n-1` (i.e., the bottom-right corner is reached).
2. Return 0 if `i >= m` or `j >= n` (out of grid bounds).
3. Otherwise, recursively call `countPaths(i + 1, j)` (move down) and `countPaths(i, j + 1)` (move right), then sum the results.

### Time and Space Complexity of Brute Force:

**Interviewer:** What would be the time and space complexity of this brute force approach?

**Interviewee:** The brute force solution would exhibit exponential time complexity, \(O(2^{m+n})\), because at each step we have two choices and there's a proliferation of overlapping subproblems. The space complexity would be \(O(m + n)\), accounting for the maximum depth of the recursion stack.

### Optimizing with Dynamic Programming:

**Interviewer:** Given the inefficiency of the brute force method, how can we optimize this?

**Interviewee:** We can use dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations. We create a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of unique paths to reach cell `(i, j)`.

**Interviewer:** How would you fill the DP array?

**Interviewee:** 
1. Initialize `dp[0][0] = 1` since there's only one way to be at the start.
2. For each cell `(i, j)`, `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]`, if they are within bounds.
3. Return `dp[m-1][n-1]`.

### Time and Space Complexity of Dynamic Programming Approach:

**Interviewer:** What are the time and space complexities with this approach?

**Interviewee:** Both the time and space complexities are \(O(m \times n)\), because we fill an \(m \times n\) matrix and each cell computation is done in constant time.

### Visual Explanation with Diagram:
Let’s draw a grid for `m = 3` and `n = 3` to illustrate how the DP table is filled.

Consider a grid like this:
```
1 1 1
1 2 3
1 3 6
```

The robot can only move right or down:

1. The first row and first column will be filled with 1s, as there's only one way to move horizontally across or vertically down.
2. Each cell \( dp[i][j] \) will be the sum of the cell directly above it and the cell to its immediate left.

Here's a visual representation for a 3x3 grid.

```
+---+---+---+
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
+---+---+---+
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
+---+---+---+
| 1 | 3 | 6 |
+---+---+---+
```

The value at the bottom-right corner (`dp[2][2] = 6`) represents the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.

**Interviewer:** Excellent! You’ve provided a clear, optimized solution using dynamic programming.
Sure! I'll provide the solution using dynamic programming for each language you listed.

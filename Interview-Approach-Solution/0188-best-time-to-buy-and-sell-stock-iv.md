### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer:** Let's discuss a problem where you're given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i-th` day, and an integer `k`. You need to find the maximum profit you can achieve, but you may complete at most `k` transactions. Remember, you cannot engage in multiple transactions simultaneously, meaning you must sell your stock before you buy again.

**Interviewee:** Alright, this sounds interesting. Just for clarification, each transaction is a pair of buying and selling?

**Interviewer:** Exactly.

**Interviewee:** Great. Let's start by breaking down the problem. In the simplest case where `k=1`, we just need to find the best day to buy and the best future day to sell to maximize profit. But with multiple transactions allowed, we need a more sophisticated strategy to keep track of multiple buy and sell operations.

**Interviewer:** Right. What would be your initial approach to solve this problem?

### Initial Thoughts and Brute Force Approach

**Interviewee:** As an initial brute force approach, I can think of generating all possible transactions and then combining them in a way to ensure that we pick the best `k` transactions to maximize the profit. This would involve:

1. Iterating over all possible pairs of buy and sell days to generate profits for individual transactions.
2. Combining all possible transactions in a way to pick the maximum `k` transactions.

This brute force approach would involve considering all combinations which can get computationally expensive.

**Interviewer:** That sounds like a good start. What can you say about the complexity of this brute force approach?

**Interviewee:** Let's see. If we have `n` days:
- Generating all pairs of buy and sell days takes `O(n^2)` time.
- Combining these transactions to determine the best `k` transactions would involve sorting them and selecting the top `k` which would take roughly `O(n^2 log n^2)` time in the worst case.

Overall, the brute force approach would have a time complexity of `O(n^2 log n)` for the transaction selection part. The space complexity would be similar since we need to store the profits of all possible transactions.

### Optimizing the Approach with Dynamic Programming

**Interviewer:** That's quite comprehensive. Now, can you think of any ways to optimize this approach using more efficient data structures or algorithms?

**Interviewee:** Sure! The brute-force method isn't efficient for large inputs. We can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem more efficiently. Here's how I would approach it:

1. We define a DP array `dp[i][j]` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum profit we can achieve by using `i` transactions up to the `j-th` day.
2. We'll initialize the array with:
   - `dp[0][j] = 0` meaning 0 profit with 0 transactions.
   - `dp[i][0] = 0` meaning 0 profit on the 0-th day.
3. We can fill this array using the recurrence relation that captures the essence of either performing a transaction or not performing one:
   \[
   dp[i][j] = \max(dp[i][j-1], prices[j] + max_{m<j}(dp[i-1][m] - prices[m]))
   \]

   Essentially, for each day, we decide whether to use the current price to modify our profit or to carry forward the previous profit.

Here's a more detailed breakdown and visualization:

```text
For i = 1 to k (for each transaction)
   For j = 1 to n-1 (for each day after the first)
      Initialize maxDiff = -prices[0]
      For t = 1 to j
	      maxDiff = max(maxDiff, dp[i-1][t-1] - prices[t-1])
	      dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], prices[j] + maxDiff)
```

Using this approach, we can calculate the maximum profit in O(kn) time.

### Time and Space Complexity

**Interviewer:** What's the time and space complexity of this dynamic programming approach?

**Interviewee:**
- **Time Complexity:** O(kn) since we are iterating over each transaction and day.
- **Space Complexity:** O(kn) for the DP table.

**Interviewer:** Sounds good. Could you draw a quick example to illustrate this?

**Interviewee:**

Here's a visual example of how the DP table would be filled for `prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]` and `k = 2`.

| Transactions \ Days | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---------------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0                   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1                   | 0 | 0 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 |
| 2                   | 0 | 0 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 7 |

- For `dp[1][2]`, the best single transaction profit realized by day 2 from the first transaction is buying at day 1 (price 2) and selling at day 3 (price 6), so `dp[1][2] = 4`.

- For `dp[2][5]`, the best profit from two transactions would be buying at day 1 and selling at day 3, and then buying at day 5 and selling at day 6.

**Interviewer:** Excellent! This thorough explanation and breakdown make the problem and solution very clear.
Below are the code implementations for each language using dynamic programming to find the maximum profit with at most `k` transactions.

            for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
                if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1])
                    maxProfit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
            }
            return maxProfit;
        }

        let n = prices.len();
        if n == 0 {
            return 0;
        }
        
        if k as usize >= n / 2 {
            let mut max_profit = 0;
            for i in 1..n {
                if prices[i] > prices[i - 1] {
                    max_profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
                }
            }
            return max_profit;
        }
        
        let mut dp = vec![vec![0; n]; (k + 1) as usize];
        for i in 1..=k {
            let mut max_diff = -prices[0];
            for j in 1..n {
                dp[i as usize][j] = dp[i as usize][j - 1].max(prices[j] + max_diff);
                max_diff = max_diff.max(dp[(i - 1) as usize][j] - prices[j]);
            }
        }
        
        dp[k as usize][next.len() - 1]
    }
}

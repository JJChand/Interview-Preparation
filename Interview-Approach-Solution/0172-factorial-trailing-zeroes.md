### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer:** Today, we'd like you to solve a problem related to trailing zeros in factorials. Given an integer `n`, return the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`. Do you understand the problem statement?

**Interviewee:** Yes, I need to count the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of a given integer `n`.

**Interviewer:** Correct. Can you first explain what you think would be a brute force approach to solving this problem?

**Interviewee:** Sure. The brute force way would be to first calculate the factorial of `n`. Then, I would keep dividing by 10 while the number is divisible by 10 to count how many trailing zeros there are.

**Interviewer:** That sounds good. Can you elaborate on the time and space complexity of this brute force approach?

**Interviewee:** 
- **Time Complexity:** Calculating factorial involves multiplying `n` numbers. In the worst case, for `n = 10^4`, the factorial would be an extremely large value, making the multiplication process O(n). Additionally, counting the trailing zeros involves converting this large number to string and then counting zeros, which would be an O(m) operation, where m is the number of digits, potentially making it impractical.
- **Space Complexity:** Storing such a large number would also require a significant amount of space proportional to the number of digits in `n!`, which can be very large. Hence, it is inefficient.

**Interviewer:** Your analysis is correct. Can you think of any better solution or optimization using some mathematical properties?

**Interviewee:** Yes. Trailing zeros in a number are created by factors of 10, and factors of 10 are composed of pairs of factors 2 and 5. In a factorial, we have always more factors of 2 than factors of 5. Therefore, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`.

To count the number of factors of 5:
1. Count the number of multiples of 5.
2. Count the number of multiples of 25 (each contributing at least two factors of 5).
3. Count the number of multiples of 125, and so on.

I can use a while loop that iteratively divides `n` by 5, 25, 125, etc., until the quotient is zero, and sum up all these quotients.

### Code Implementation

Here is the optimized solution:

```python
def trailingZeroes(n: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    power_of_5 = 5
    while n // power_of_5 > 0:
        count += n // power_of_5
        power_of_5 *= 5
    return count
```

### Explanation

Let me draw a simple flow to help illustrate:

```
n! can be split into:
n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1

We're interested in trailing zeros (factors of 10).
10 = 2 * 5

Example for n = 25:
- Factors of 5 in {1, 2, ..., 25}: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 -> There are 6 factors of 5 (including 25 counted twice because 25 = 5^2)

So, for any n:
- Count multiples of 5: `n // 5`
- Then count multiples of 25: `n // 25`
- Continue for 125, 625, etc.

Illustration of count updates for n = 25:
count = 0
count += 25 // 5         -> count = 5
count += 25 // 25        -> count = 6
stop when 25 // 125 == 0 -> final count = 6
```

**Interviewer:** That makes sense. What's the time complexity and space complexity of this optimized approach?

**Interviewee:** 
- **Time Complexity:** O(log_5(n)), since we are iteratively dividing `n` by 5.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), because we are using only a few extra variables.

**Interviewer:** Excellent! This optimized solution is very efficient. Good job!

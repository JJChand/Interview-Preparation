### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer**: Today, we are going to work on an interesting problem. Given two integers `left` and `right` that represent a range `[left, right]`, we need to return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive. Are you familiar with this type of problem?

**Interviewee**: Yes, I think so. The bitwise AND operation, also known as the conjunction operator, compares corresponding bits of the operands and returns 1 if both bits are 1; otherwise, it returns 0.

**Interviewer**: Great! Now, do you have any initial thoughts on how you would approach this problem?

**Interviewee**: Initially, I would think of a brute force approach. We could iterate through the range from `left` to `right` and perform a bitwise AND operation for each number in the range. By maintaining a result variable initialized to `left`, we can continuously AND the current result with the next number in the range until we reach `right`.

**Interviewer**: That sounds like a good start. Could you please write down the brute force approach and compute its time and space complexity?

### Initial Thoughts and Brute Force Approach

```python
def rangeBitwiseAnd(left: int, right: int) -> int:
    result = left
    for num in range(left + 1, right + 1):
        result &= num
        # Early termination if result is 0
        if result == 0:
            break
    return result
```

**Interviewee**: For the brute force solution, we initialize `result` as `left`, and then for each number in the range from `left+1` to `right`, we use the bitwise AND operator with the current result. We also perform an early termination if the result becomes 0, since anything AND-ed with 0 will continue to be 0.

**Interviewer**: That makes sense. Now, let's discuss its time and space complexity.

**Interviewee**: The time complexity for this approach would be O(n), where n is the size of the range `[left, right]`. In the worst case, we would iterate through all numbers in the range to compute the final result.

The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of extra space to store the result and the loop variable.

### Optimization and Efficient Data Structures

**Interviewer**: Can you think of a way to optimize this solution? Is there a more efficient approach?

**Interviewee**: Yes, definitely. We can use bitwise properties to optimize this. The bitwise AND of a range tends to strip off the differing least significant bits as we proceed through the range. We should find the common prefix of `left` and `right`. By continuously shifting `left` and `right` to the right until they are the same, we are effectively finding the common bits in their highest positions. The number of shifts will give us the lower bits which are insignificant. Finally, shift the common prefix back to the left by the same number of times.

**Interviewer**: That sounds interesting. Could you implement this optimized approach?

```python
def rangeBitwiseAnd(left: int, right: int) -> int:
    shift = 0
    # Find the common prefix
    while left < right:
        left >>= 1
        right >>= 1
        shift += 1
        
    # Shift the common prefix back to its original position
    return left << shift
```

### Explanation with Drawing

1. Given `left = 5` and `right = 7`, observe their binary representations:
    - 5: 101
    - 6: 110
    - 7: 111

2. While `left < right`:
    - Step 1: 101 (5) and 111 (7), shift both:  010 and 011
    - Step 2: 010 and 011, shift again: 001 and 001

3. The loops stop when `left` equals `right` (1 in this case).

4. Shift back the common prefix:
    - 001 shifted back (by 2 positions) becomes 100 (which is 4 in decimal).

The AND result in this range is 4.

**Interviewer**: Well done! This approach ensures optimal time complexity. Can you discuss the time and space complexity for this optimized solution?

**Interviewee**: Of course. The time complexity for this optimized solution is O(log N), where N is the range length. This is because we are shifting right to align `left` and `right`.

The space complexity remains O(1), as we are only using a few extra variables for shifting and storing the result.

### Closing Statement

In our discussion, we tackled the problem of calculating the bitwise AND of all numbers within a given range `[left, right]`. Initially, we discussed a brute force approach and analyzed its time and space complexities. We then optimized the solution using bitwise properties to find the common prefix of `left` and `right`, which significantly enhanced the performance. We implemented these optimizations across multiple programming languages, ensuring each solution is both efficient and readable with a time complexity of O(log N) and space complexity of O(1).

Leveraging bitwise operations not only improved our solution's efficiency but also showcased an important approach to solving range-based problems in a computationally effective manner.

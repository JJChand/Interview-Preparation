**Interviewer:** Let's take a look at this SQL problem. You are given a 'Weather' table with columns: `id`, `recordDate`, and `temperature`. You need to find the `id` of all dates where the temperature was higher compared to the temperature of the previous day. Let's start discussing how you would approach this problem.

**Interviewee:** Okay, sure. Let me break it down step by step. First, we can approach this problem with a brute force method, where we check every date against its previous date's temperature.

**Interviewer:** How exactly would you implement the brute force approach?

**Interviewee:** To implement it in a brute force manner, we would iterate through the data and compare each day’s temperature with the previous day’s temperature. In SQL, we could achieve this using a self join where the table is joined with itself based on the `recordDate` being one day apart.

**Interviewer:** Could you explain more about how you would write the SQL query for this brute force method and let's also discuss its time and space complexity?

**Interviewee:** Sure. Here's how I would write the brute force SQL query:

```sql
SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather w1
JOIN Weather w2 
ON DATE_SUB(w1.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY) = w2.recordDate
WHERE w1.temperature > w2.temperature;
```

In this query, `w1` represents the current day's record, and `w2` represents the previous day's record. We use the condition `DATE_SUB(w1.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY) = w2.recordDate` to match each day with its previous day, and then we check if the current day's temperature is greater than the previous day's temperature.

**Interviewer:** That makes sense. Let's analyze the time and space complexity of this approach.

**Interviewee:** For the time complexity:

- The self join operation should have a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case because the join operation needs to compare each record with every other record.

For the space complexity:

- It would be \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the number of rows in the table as it stores the matching records temporarily.

**Interviewer:** Great. This brute force method might work for smaller datasets but could be slow for large ones. Can you think of a way to optimize this?

**Interviewee:** Yes. We can certainly optimize this by using window functions. Specifically, the `LAG` window function in SQL allows us to access the value of a previous row in the result set. This would reduce the need for a self join and make the query more efficient.

**Interviewer:** How will you implement the optimized approach using the `LAG` function?

**Interviewee:** Here's how I would write the optimized SQL query using the `LAG` function:

```sql
WITH TemperatureLag AS (
    SELECT
        id,
        recordDate,
        temperature,
        LAG(temperature) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS prevTemperature
    FROM Weather
)
SELECT id
FROM TemperatureLag
WHERE temperature > prevTemperature;
```

**Interviewer:** Explain a bit about how this SQL query works.

**Interviewee:** Sure. In this query, we use a common table expression (CTE) called `TemperatureLag` to generate a new column `prevTemperature` which holds the temperature of the previous day using the `LAG` function. The `ORDER BY recordDate` ensures that we look at the previous day's temperature correctly. Finally, we select the `id` of the records where the current day's temperature is higher than the previous day's temperature.

**Interviewer:** Excellent. What about the time and space complexity for this optimized query?

**Interviewee:** For the optimized method, the time complexity improves to \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting operation required by `ORDER BY`. The space complexity remains \(O(n)\) as we still store additional information for the previous temperature.

**Interviewer:** Thank you for the explanation. Can you also provide a drawing to illustrate how the `LAG` function works?

**Interviewee:** Sure, let me illustrate it:

```
+----+------------+-------------+----------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature | prevTemperature|
+----+------------+-------------+----------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          | NULL           |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          | 10             |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          | 25             |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          | 20             |
+----+------------+-------------+----------------+
```

In the table, `prevTemperature` is the value of the `temperature` from the previous row. We then simply compare `temperature` with `prevTemperature` to filter out the results.
Certainly! Below is the code for each specified language, including the SQL and Pandas versions along with explanations for time and space complexity.

### MySQL
```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH TemperatureLag AS (
    SELECT
        id,
        recordDate,
        temperature,
        LAG(temperature) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS prevTemperature
    FROM Weather
)
SELECT id
FROM TemperatureLag
WHERE temperature > prevTemperature;
```
**Time Complexity:** O(n log n) due to the sorting required by `ORDER BY`.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for storing the intermediate results.

### MS SQL Server

        temperature,
        LAG(temperature) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS prevTemperature
    FROM Weather
)
SELECT id
FROM TemperatureLag
WHERE temperature > prevTemperature;
```
**Time Complexity:** O(n log n).
**Space Complexity:** O(n).

### Oracle
```oraclesql
/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */
WITH TemperatureLag AS (
    SELECT
        id,
        recordDate,
        temperature,
        LAG(temperature) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS prevTemperature
    FROM Weather
)
SELECT id

```
**Time Complexity:** O(n log n).
**Space Complexity:** O(n).

### Pandas
```pythondata
import pandas as pd

def rising_temperature(weather: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    weather['prevTemperature'] = weather['temperature'].shift(1)
    result = weather[weather['temperature'] > weather['prevTemperature']]
    return result[['id']]
```
**Time Complexity:** O(n) for the shift operation and filtering.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for storing the new `prevTemperature` column.

### PostgreSQL
```postgresql
-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below
WITH TemperatureLag AS (
    SELECT
        id,
        recordDate,
        temperature,
        LAG(temperature) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS prevTemperature
    FROM Weather
)
SELECT id
FROM TemperatureLag
WHERE temperature > prevTemperature;
```
**Time Complexity:** O(n log n).
**Space Complexity:** O(n).

These strategies use the LAG window function which provides a highly efficient way to access previous rows, significantly optimizing the query compared to a self join operation. The Pandas implementation achieves the same result utilizing the `shift` function to compare rows without any explicit join or window function.


### Closing Statement:

In this discussion, we have explored the problem of identifying dates with rising temperatures from a 'Weather' table. We started with a brute force approach using self joins, which helped us understand the basic requirements and potential pitfalls of such methods regarding time and space complexity. We then transitioned to a more optimized solution using the `LAG` window function, significantly improving performance by reducing the complexity of the operation. Additionally, we provided a Pandas DataFrame implementation for Python enthusiasts, showcasing how similar logic can be applied within a different ecosystem.

These methods illustrate the importance of choosing the right tools and techniques for data processing tasks in SQL and Python. By leveraging window functions, we can avoid inefficient joins and make our queries more performant. 

**Time and Space Complexity:**
- Optimized SQL Query (using `LAG`): **O(n log n)** for time complexity and **O(n)** for space complexity.
- Pandas Implementation: **O(n)** for time complexity and **O(n)** for space complexity.

By understanding these complexities and optimizing our queries, we ensure that our solutions are scalable and efficient, making them suitable for larger datasets.

### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer**: Let's discuss a problem. You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following structure:

```cpp
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
```

Initially, all `next` pointers are set to `NULL`. Your task is to populate each `next` pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the `next` pointer should be set to `NULL`.

**Interviewee**: Understood. Just to clarify, the goal is to set the `next` pointers such that each node points to its next right neighbor on the same level, correct?

**Interviewer**: Exactly. For example, in the given binary tree,

```
        1
      /   \
    2       3
   / \     / \
  4   5   6   7
```

the output should have `next` pointers such that:

```
        1 -> NULL
      /    \
    2   ->   3 -> NULL
   / \     /   \
  4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> NULL
```

**Interviewee**: Got it. We can use level-order traversal (akin to breadth-first search) to connect the nodes on the same level. We can start by discussing the brute force approach and then consider optimizing it.

### Initial Thoughts on Brute Force Approach

**Interviewee**: In a brute force approach, we can use a queue to perform a level-order traversal. Here’s the step-by-step process:

1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the root node.
2. Traverse each level:
   - For each node in the current level, set its `next` pointer to the next node in the queue.
   - Enqueue the children of the current node for the next level's processing.
3. Repeat until all levels are processed.

This approach ensures that each node's `next` pointer points to the appropriate node on the same level, or `NULL` if it’s the last node in that level.

### Time and Space Complexity of Brute Force Approach

**Interviewee**:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) due to the usage of the queue which, in the worst case, would hold all nodes at the last level. In a perfect binary tree, the last level has O(n/2) nodes.

### Optimizing the Approach

**Interviewer**: Can we optimize this approach further, perhaps in terms of space complexity?

**Interviewee**: Yes. Given that it's a perfect binary tree, we can take advantage of this structure to improve our space complexity. Specifically, we can use the `next` pointers to traverse each level and link the nodes without using extra space.

Here's a refined approach:

1. Start with the leftmost node of the current level (initially, this is the root).
2. For each node in the current level:
   - Link the left child to the right child.
   - If there's a `next` node for the current parent, link the right child of the current parent to the left child of the next parent.
3. Move to the next level by setting the current node to its left child.
4. Repeat until there are no more nodes to process.

This approach only uses the tree itself (its `next` pointers) for traversal, resulting in constant additional space.

**Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes. Each node is processed once.
**Space Complexity**: O(1), since no additional space is used beyond the input tree.

### Drawing Explanation

Here's a visual step-by-step example:
```
Initial tree:
        1
      /   \
    2       3
   / \     / \
  4   5   6   7

Step-by-step process:

1. Link 2 -> 3 (children of 1)
   1
  / \
2 -> 3
/ \   / \
4  5 6  7

2. Link 4 -> 5 and 5 -> 6, followed by 6 -> 7 (children of 2 and 3)
    1
  /   \
 2 ->  3
/ \   / \
4->5->6->7

3. Move to the next level and repeat. Since 4, 5, 6, and 7 are leaves, no further action needed.
```

### Optimized Code

Here’s how we could write this optimized approach in code:

```cpp
void connect(Node* root) {
    if (!root) return;

    // Start with the leftmost node of the tree
    Node* leftmost = root;

    while (leftmost->left) {  // While there are levels to process
        Node* head = leftmost;
        while (head) {
            // Link the left and right children
            head->left->next = head->right;
            // Link the right child to the next subtree's left child
            if (head->next) {
                head->right->next = head->next->left;
            }
            // Move to the next node in the current level
            head = head->next;
        }
        // Move to the next level
        leftmost = leftmost->left;
    }
}
```

**Interviewer**: Excellent explanation! This approach efficiently uses the properties of the perfect binary tree to minimize space usage while maintaining time efficiency. Thank you!
Sure! Let's implement the optimized solution in each provided programming language, ensuring the correct time and space complexity.

Each of these implementations follows the optimized algorithm discussed earlier with the time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1) (excluding the recursive stack space). These solutions effectively use the structure of the given perfect binary tree.


### Closing Statement

In this discussion, we addressed the problem of populating each `next` pointer in a perfect binary tree to point to its next right node. We explored a brute force approach using level-order traversal, then optimized the solution by leveraging the properties of the perfect binary tree to achieve constant space complexity. 

We provided implementations in several programming languages, ensuring that they adhere to the desired time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1) (excluding recursive stack space).

The optimized solution efficiently connects each node with its next right neighbor without using extra space, demonstrating an elegant use of the tree's inherent structure. This problem is a common interview question that tests understanding of tree traversal, space optimization, and pointer manipulation.

### Similar Questions

1. **Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II**:
   - Given a binary tree (not necessarily perfect), populate each `next` pointer to point to its next right node, if it exists. This requires handling trees of arbitrary shapes.

2. **Binary Tree Level Order Traversal**:
   - Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

3. **Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree**:
   - Given a binary tree, return the vertical order traversal of its nodes’ values. (i.e., nodes at the same vertical order are grouped together).

4. **Binary Tree Right Side View**:
   - Given a binary tree, return the values of the nodes that are visible when looking at the tree from the right side.

5. **Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree**:
   - Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

6. **Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree**:
   - Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree, converting it between a tree and a string representation and vice versa.

7. **Maximum Depth of Binary Tree**:
   - Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth. The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

These problems are excellent follow-ups to further practice tree-related algorithms and deepen understanding of tree data structures in various contexts.

**Interviewer:** Let's discuss a problem that involves a broken calculator. The calculator initially displays an integer `startValue`. From here, you can perform one of two operations: either multiply the displayed number by 2, or subtract 1 from it. Given two integers `startValue` and `target`, we want to determine the minimum number of operations needed to change the `startValue` to `target`. For example:

- **Example 1:** If `startValue = 2` and `target = 3`, the output is `2` because we can go from `2 -> 4 -> 3` using multiplication and then subtraction.
- **Example 2:** If `startValue = 5` and `target = 8`, the output is `2` because we can go from `5 -> 4 -> 8` using subtraction and then multiplication.
- **Example 3:** If `startValue = 3` and `target = 10`, the output is `3` because we can go from `3 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10` using multiplication, subtraction, and then multiplication.

Given these examples, how would you approach solving this problem?

**Interviewee:** To start, I would consider the simplest brute force approach. I would simulate the two possible operations starting from `startValue` and apply them in every possible combination until I reach `target`.

**Interviewer:** Okay, letâ€™s talk through that brute force approach and its complexities.

**Interviewee:** Sure. In brute force, we start from `startValue` and recursively apply the operations of multiplying by 2 or subtracting 1 until we reach the `target`.

**Interviewer:** What would be the time complexity of this brute force approach?

**Interviewee:** The time complexity is exponential in the worst case because for each value, we'd explore two paths (multiply by 2 or subtract 1). So, we essentially create a binary tree of operations leading to an exponential number of states to explore. It's roughly in the order of `O(2^n)`, where `n` is the number of operations required to reach the target.
 
**Interviewer:** And the space complexity?

**Interviewee:** The space complexity would mainly come from the recursion stack, so it's `O(n)` in the worst case where `n` is the depth of the recursion tree.

**Interviewer:** That's a good analysis. Can we optimize this further?

**Interviewee:** Yes, we can optimize this by working backwards from `target`. Starting from `target`, we reverse the operations until we reach `startValue`. Specifically:
- If `target` is greater than `startValue` and even, divide it by 2 (reverse of multiplying by 2).
- If `target` is greater than `startValue` and odd, add 1 to it (so that the next step we can divide by 2).

By reversing operations, we can reduce the complexity significantly because we always move towards reducing the target to the `startValue`.

**Interviewer:** That sounds promising! Could you describe the time complexity of this approach?

**Interviewee:** This approach will have a time complexity of `O(log(target))`, as each division by 2 operation reduces the target significantly. Each additive operation keeps the process efficient.

**Interviewer:** And the space complexity?

**Interviewee:** Since we're using a simple loop and not deep recursion, the space complexity is `O(1)` with respect to additional memory.

**Interviewer:** Great! Could you sketch this process out for `startValue = 3` and `target = 10`?

**Interviewee:** Absolutely! Let's draw this out step-by-step:

1. **startValue = 3**
2. Start from **target = 10**:
   - Since 10 is even, divide by 2: **10 / 2 = 5**
   - Next, target is 5, which is odd, so increment by 1: **5 + 1 = 6**
   - Now, 6 is even, divide by 2: **6 / 2 = 3**
   
So, we get the steps:
- `10 -> 5 -> 6 -> 3`
Reversing these gives us:
- `3 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10`

Here's a diagram to visualize it:

```plaintext
   10
  /   \
 5  (divide by 2)
  \
   6 (add 1)
  /   \
 3  (divide by 2)
```

And that's exactly what the optimized process looks like. 

**Interviewer:** Excellent, that clarifies the optimized solution well! Let's move on to writing the code for it. Would you like to proceed with that?

## Closing Statement

We have successfully discussed and implemented the solution for the "Broken Calculator" problem using various programming languages. By initially considering a brute-force approach, we recognized its inefficiencies and shifted to a more optimal strategy that employs a reverse approach. This method allowed us to achieve a time complexity of `O(log(target))` and a space complexity of `O(1)`. 

This approach ensures that we can handle the problem within feasible limits, even for large values up to `10^9`. Understanding and implementing this optimized method not only solves the problem at hand but also promotes critical thinking about how to approach similar algorithmic challenges.

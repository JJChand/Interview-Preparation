**Interviewer:** Let's discuss the problem statement. You are given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`. You need to return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

**Interviewee:** Got it. To clarify with an example, if `nums = [3, 0, 1]`, I need to return `2` because the numbers in the range `[0, 3]` should be `{0, 1, 2, 3}`, and `2` is the number that is missing.

**Interviewer:** Exactly. Let's start with some initial thoughts. How would you approach solving this problem using a brute force method?

**Interviewee:** For a brute force solution, we could simply check each number from `0` to `n` to see if it's in the array. Here's how we can do that:
1. Iterate through every number `i` from `0` to `n`.
2. For each `i`, check if it’s present in `nums`.
3. Return the first number that is not present.

This approach leverages nested loops, where the outer loop runs `n+1` times and the inner check (which scans the array to find the element) also runs in linear time. This would result in a time complexity of `O(n^2)`.

**Interviewer:** Good first step. Can you explain the time and space complexity of this brute force approach?

**Interviewee:** Certainly.
- **Time Complexity:** Since we are using a nested loop where each element in the range `[0, n]` is checked against all elements in `nums`, the time complexity would be `O(n^2)`.
- **Space Complexity:** We don’t use any additional data structure or space, so the space complexity is `O(1)`.

**Interviewer:** That makes sense. Since `O(n^2)` is not efficient for large values of `n`, can you think of a more efficient way to solve this problem?

**Interviewee:** Absolutely. One optimized approach can be achieved using a mathematical concept—let's leverage the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. The idea is:
1. Calculate the expected sum of numbers in the range `[0, n]` using the formula `sum_expected = n * (n + 1) / 2`.
2. Calculate the sum of elements currently present in the array `nums`.
3. The difference between `sum_expected` and the actual sum of `nums` will be the missing number.

Here’s the visual explanation:
- Calculate `sum_expected` for the example `nums = [3, 0, 1]` (where `n = 3`):
  ```
  sum_expected = 3 * (3 + 1) / 2 = 6
  ```
- Calculate the sum of elements in `nums`:
  ```
  sum_nums = 3 + 0 + 1 = 4
  ```
- The missing number will be:
  ```
  missing_number = sum_expected - sum_nums = 6 - 4 = 2
  ```

**Interviewer:** Great explanation. Can you detail the time and space complexity of this optimized approach?

**Interviewee:** Sure.
- **Time Complexity:** Calculating the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is `O(1)`, and calculating the sum of the `nums` array is `O(n)`. So, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.
- **Space Complexity:** We are only using a few extra variables (`sum_expected` and `sum_nums`), so the space complexity is `O(1)`.

**Interviewer:** Nice. This looks well optimized. Can we proceed with this approach?

**Interviewee:** Certainly. The code implementation would look like this:
```python
def missingNumber(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    sum_expected = n * (n + 1) // 2
    sum_nums = sum(nums)
    return sum_expected - sum_nums
```

This method ensures an efficient `O(n)` runtime and `O(1)` space solution.

Sure, here's a closing statement along with some similar questions.

**Closing Statement:**

In this discussion, we've explored the problem of finding the missing number in a given array of distinct numbers within a specified range. Starting with a brute-force approach, we analyzed its time and space complexities, recognizing the inefficiencies for larger input sizes. We then optimized the solution using a mathematical deduction based on the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, resulting in a linear time complexity `O(n)` and constant space complexity `O(1)`. We also implemented this optimized solution across various programming languages, ensuring clarity in understanding how the solution can be generalized across different coding environments. This exercise not only reinforces the importance of optimization but also demonstrates how mathematical insights can lead to more efficient algorithms.

4. **Maximum XOR of Two Numbers in an Array (LeetCode 421)**:
   - Given a non-empty array of integers, find the maximum result of `nums[i] XOR nums[j]`, where `0 ≤ i < j < n`.

5. **Set Mismatch (LeetCode 645)**:
   - You have a set of integers `s`, which originally contained all the numbers from `1` to `n`. However, due to some error, one of the numbers in `s` got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in a set containing `n` numbers and mean one number is missing, and another number is duplicated. Find both the duplicate and the missing values.

### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer:** Let's discuss the problem where you are given a non-empty array of integers `nums`, and every element in this array appears twice except for one, which appears only once. The task is to find that single element. The catch is, you need to implement a solution with linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space. How would you approach this?

**Interviewee:** To begin with, we can discuss the brute force approach. One naive way to solve this problem is by using nested loops to compare each element with every other element in the array.

**Interviewer:** That makes sense. Can you explain that in more detail?

**Interviewee:** Sure. We can take each element in the array and count its occurrences by iterating through the array. If the count is 1, we know it is the unique element. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Iterate over the array and select each element one by one (we'll call this the outer loop).
2. For each selected element, run another loop that goes through the entire array to count the number of times the selected element appears (the inner loop).
3. If the count is 1 after the inner loop, that element is our answer.
   
However, this approach has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) due to the nested loops.

**Interviewer:** That's correct. Since we are required to achieve a linear time complexity, this brute-force method won't be efficient enough. Can we optimize this?

**Interviewee:** Absolutely. Instead of the brute force method, we can use a more efficient approach with the help of a hash map. Here’s how:

1. Create a hash map to store the frequency of each element.
2. Traverse the array and update the frequency count of each element in the hash map.
3. Iterate through the hash map to find the element with a frequency count of 1, which is our unique element.

This approach improves the time complexity to \(O(n)\) but will need \(O(n)\) extra space for the hash map, which does not meet the constraint of using only constant extra space.

**Interviewer:** That sounds more efficient, but can we achieve this with constant extra space?

**Interviewee:** Yes, we can! To meet the requirements of \(O(n)\) time complexity and constant space, we can utilize the XOR bitwise operator. Here’s the approach using XOR:

1. Initialize a variable `unique` to 0.
2. Iterate through the array and XOR each element with `unique`.
3. After the entire array is processed, `unique` will hold the value of the single element.

This works because XOR of two same numbers is 0 and XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself. Therefore, all pairs of numbers will cancel themselves out, leaving the single unique number.

Here’s how XOR works:
\[ a \oplus a = 0 \]
\[ a \oplus 0 = a \]
\[ a \oplus b \oplus a = b \]

**Interviewer:** That’s a very clever solution! Could you please provide the implementation and discuss its time and space complexities?

**Interviewee:**
Certainly! Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
def singleNumber(nums):
    unique = 0
    for num in nums:
        unique ^= num
    return unique
```

**Time Complexity:**
- Each number is processed exactly once, making the time complexity \(O(n)\).

**Space Complexity:**
- We are using only a single extra variable `unique`, so the space complexity is \(O(1)\).

To visually explain the XOR approach:
- Suppose the array is [2, 2, 1].
- Initially, `unique` is 0.
- After processing all elements:
  - `unique = 0 ^ 2 = 2`
  - `unique = 2 ^ 2 = 0`
  - `unique = 0 ^ 1 = 1`
- Thus, the output is 1, the unique element.

```plaintext
nums: [2, 2, 1]
Initial: unique = 0
Step 1: unique = 0 ^ 2 = 2
Step 2: unique = 2 ^ 2 = 0
Step 3: unique = 0 ^ 1 = 1
Result: 1
```

### Closing Statement

We have successfully discussed and implemented a solution to the problem of finding the single number in an array where every element appears twice except for one. We initially explored the brute force approach and identified its inefficiency due to quadratic time complexity. We then moved on to more optimal solutions, starting with a hash map approach which, although linear in time complexity, requires linear additional space. Finally, we implemented the optimal solution using the XOR operation, ensuring both linear time complexity and constant space complexity. The provided code snippets handle this problem efficiently in various programming languages.

This discussion not only showcased the importance of optimizing both time and space complexity but also highlighted a practical use of bitwise operations, specifically XOR, to achieve the desired efficiency.

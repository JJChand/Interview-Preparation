### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

#### Interviewer:
Let's start with a problem where you need to find the number of structurally unique Binary Search Trees (BSTs) for a given integer `n`. The values in the BST should range from 1 to `n`. For instance, if you have `n = 3`, you should return `5` because there are exactly 5 unique BSTs that can be formed.

#### Interviewee:
Got it. So, essentially for each value from 1 to `n`, I need to consider it as the root of the BST once and then recursively determine the number of unique BSTs for the left and right subtrees.

#### Interviewer:
Exactly. Can you think of a brute force approach to solve this problem?

#### Interviewee:
Sure, let me think. In a brute force approach, I can recursively consider each number `i` from 1 to `n` as the root and split the problem into two subproblems: 
- The number of unique BSTs in the left subtree, which will have `i-1` nodes 
- The number of unique BSTs in the right subtree, which will have `n-i` nodes. 

I would sum the Cartesian product of these counts for all `i`.

Let's dive into the details.

#### Brute Force Approach

For every possible root `i` from 1 to `n`, calculate the number of unique BSTs formed:
- Using nodes less than `i` as the left subtree.
- Using nodes greater than `i` as the right subtree.

The equation recursively becomes:
\[ T(n) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} T(i-1) * T(n-i) \]

Where `T(n)` represents the number of unique BSTs that can be formed using `n` nodes.

- Base case: \( T(0) = 1 \) (An empty tree is considered one unique BST)
- Recursively find the count for each left and right subtree and multiply the results

##### Time Complexity
This brute force approach involves calculating the same subproblems multiple times, leading to an exponential time complexity \( O(2^n) \).

##### Space Complexity
The space complexity is \( O(n) \) due to the depth of the recursion stack.

#### Interviewer:
Good analysis. Can you think of a way to optimize this solution using a more efficient data structure?

#### Interviewee:
Yes, we can utilize dynamic programming to store the intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.

### Optimized Approach Using Dynamic Programming

Here's the idea:
- Use an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of unique BSTs that can be formed with `i` nodes.
- Initialize `dp[0]` to 1, since there is exactly one empty tree.
- Fill the `dp` array up to `dp[n]` using the relation discussed earlier.

The formula to fill `dp` array will remain the same:
\[ dp[n] = \sum_{i=1}^{n} dp[i-1] * dp[n-i] \]

#### Algorithm
1. Initialize an array `dp` of size `n+1` with all elements set to 0.
2. Set `dp[0] = 1`.
3. For each `i` from 1 to `n`, iterate `j` from 1 to `i` and apply the relation to update `dp[i]`.
4. The result will be in `dp[n]`.

#### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n^2) \) since we have nested loops.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \) to store the `dp` array.

Here's the code to illustrate the optimized solution:

```python
def numTrees(n: int) -> int:
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, i + 1):
            dp[i] += dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j]
    
    return dp[n]

# Example usage
print(numTrees(3))  # Output: 5
print(numTrees(1))  # Output: 1
```

### Visualization
Let's visualize this for `n = 3`:

- For `i = 3`, you have:
  - Left subtree (0 nodes) x Right subtree (2 nodes): `dp[0] * dp[2]`
  - Left subtree (1 node) x Right subtree (1 node): `dp[1] * dp[1]`
  - Left subtree (2 nodes) x Right subtree (0 nodes): `dp[2] * dp[0]`

Filling the dp array:
- `dp[0] = 1`
- `dp[1] = 1`
- `dp[2] = dp[0] * dp[1] + dp[1] * dp[0] = 1 * 1 + 1 * 1 = 2`
- `dp[3] = dp[0] * dp[2] + dp[1] * dp[1] + dp[2] * dp[0] = 1 * 2 + 1 * 1 + 2 * 1 = 5`

So the final result for `n = 3` is `dp[3] = 5`.

This approach significantly optimizes the brute force method by leveraging memoization.
Sure, I will provide the solution for each of the languages mentioned using the dynamic programming approach.

### Closing Statement

We began our discussion by understanding the problem of counting the number of structurally unique Binary Search Trees (BSTs) given `n` nodes with unique values ranging from 1 to `n`. We initially explored a brute force approach, which had significant time complexity (exponential). To optimize, we used dynamic programming to reduce the time complexity to \( O(n^2) \) and space complexity to \( O(n) \). Subsequently, solutions in various programming languages including C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, and others were provided, each using the optimized approach.

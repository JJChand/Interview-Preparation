### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer**:  
Let's discuss a problem where you need to populate each next pointer of a given binary tree node to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`. Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`. Let's take the example illustrated below:

```
Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,7,#]
```

Can you share your initial thoughts on how you might approach this problem?

**Interviewee**: 
Sure. To begin with, we need to ensure all nodes in the given binary tree are connected to their next right node. A brute force approach would involve performing a level-order traversal and connecting each node's next pointer to the next node at that level.

**Interviewer**:  
How would you perform the level-order traversal and link the nodes?

**Interviewee**: 
We can use a queue to perform level-order traversal. Initially, we can push the root node into the queue. While traversing, each node's next pointer would be pointed to the node that follows it in the queue, which belongs to the same level. After processing all children at the current level, we can add their children to the queue for the next level.

### Brute Force Approach
1. Initialize a Queue and add the root to it.
2. For each level, iterate through the nodes; for each node, assign its next pointer to the next node in the queue. Set the last node's next pointer to `NULL`.
3. Add children of each node to the queue and process them in the next iteration.

**Interviewer**:  
Sounds good. What can you say about the time and space complexity of this approach?

**Interviewee**:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\) - We visit each node once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) - Queue will store nodes of one level at a time, and in the worst case of a full binary tree, it will store \( \frac{n}{2} \) nodes.

**Interviewer**:  
Can we optimize this approach to use constant space, apart from the space used by recursion?

**Interviewee**:
Yes, we can optimize it using a dummy node technique. Instead of using a queue, we could use pointers to keep track of each level.

### Optimized Approach using Constant Space

1. Use a dummy node to keep track of the head of the next level.
2. Initialize a current node pointer starting at the root.
3. For each node at the current level, connect its left and right children using the next pointer.
4. Move to the next node using the next pointers and repeat until all levels are connected.

**Interviewer**:
Can you provide code for this optimized approach?

**Interviewee**: 
Certainly! Here is the optimized solution using pointers:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void connect(Node* root) {
        if (!root) return;
        
        Node* current = root;  // Pointer to navigate nodes at current level
        Node* nextHead = new Node(0);  // Dummy node for next level
        Node* nextTail = nextHead;     // Tail node to build the next level list

        while (current) { 
            if (current->left) {
                nextTail->next = current->left;
                nextTail = nextTail->next;
            }
            if (current->right) {
                nextTail->next = current->right;
                nextTail = nextTail->next;
            }
            // Move to next node in the same level
            current = current->next;
            if (!current) {
                current = nextHead->next;
                nextHead->next = nullptr; // Reset for the next level
                nextTail = nextHead;
            }
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation with Diagram
Let me draw an illustrative diagram of this approach:

```
Level 1:        1 -> NULL
                 |
Level 2:    2 -> 3 -> NULL
               |    |
Level 3:  4 -> 5    7 -> NULL
```

At each step, the dummy node helps us connect the children of nodes of the current level, and we move to the next level once the current level is fully processed.

**Interviewer**:  
Great! This approach is much more space-efficient while maintaining \(O(n)\) time complexity. Thank you for your explanation and code.

### Time and Space Complexity Analysis
For all implementations:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree. Every node is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), considering the requirement to use constant extra space. Although the recursive stack space is used implicitly, it does not count towards the space complexity in this problem.


### Closing Statement

In this discussion, we explored a problem where we needed to populate each `next` pointer of a given binary tree node to point to its next right node. We started by considering a brute force approach using level-order traversal with a queue, and then optimized our solution to achieve constant space complexity through the use of a dummy node technique. We implemented the optimized solution across multiple programming languages, ensuring adherence to the specified constraints.

This problem not only helped us reinforce our understanding of tree traversals but also illustrated how to use additional pointers effectively to accomplish the task within space constraints. Understanding these techniques is crucial for mastering tree manipulation and pointer management, which are common in many real-world applications and technical interviews.

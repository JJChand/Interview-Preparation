### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer:** Let's consider a problem where you're given a non-negative integer `x`, and you need to return its square root rounded down to the nearest integer. Keep in mind that you shouldn't use any built-in functions or operators for exponentiation or square roots. How would you approach such a problem?

**Interviewee:** That's an interesting problem! My first thought is to use a brute force approach by iterating through possible values and finding the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to `x`. 

**Interviewer:** Okay, could you please elaborate on the brute force approach?

**Interviewee:** Sure. In brute force, we start from 0 and continue checking the square of each integer until the square exceeds `x`. The largest integer where the square is less than or equal to `x` will be our answer.

### Brute Force Approach

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:
1. Start from 0 and keep incrementing.
2. For each increment, calculate its square.
3. If the square is less than or equal to `x`, continue. If it exceeds `x`, stop.
4. The last number whose square is less than or equal to `x` is our answer.

### Implementation of Brute Force Approach (Python)

```python
def mySqrt(x):
    if x == 0:
        return 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= x:
        i += 1
    return i - 1
```

### Time and Space Complexity

**Interviewee:** The time complexity of this brute force approach is O(√x). This is because in the worst case, we might have to check all numbers up to √x. The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space that scales with input size.

**Interviewer:** Good, but can we do better than O(√x)?

**Interviewee:** Yes, we can use a more efficient method such as binary search, which will allow us to find the square root in logarithmic time.

### Optimized Approach using Binary Search

Here's how the binary search approach works:
1. Initialize two pointers, `left` as 0 and `right` as `x`.
2. While `left` is less than or equal to `right`, calculate the mid-point.
3. If the square of `mid` is less than or equal to `x`, move the left pointer to `mid + 1`.
4. If the square of `mid` is greater than `x`, move the right pointer to `mid - 1`.
5. The answer will be the last valid `mid` where mid*mid <= x.

### Implementation of Binary Search Approach (Python)

```python
def mySqrt(x):
    if x < 2:
        return x
    left, right = 1, x
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if mid * mid == x:
            return mid
        elif mid * mid < x:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return right
```

### Time and Space Complexity of Optimized Approach

**Interviewee:** The time complexity of this binary search approach is O(log x) because we're cutting the search space by half each iteration. The space complexity remains O(1) as we only use a fixed amount of extra space.

### Illustration for Binary Search Approach

Let's visualize how binary search helps us find the integer square root of 8:

```
Initial range: [1, 8]
Mid-point: (1+8)//2 = 4
4*4 = 16 which is greater than 8, so search in [1, 3]

Range is now: [1, 3]
Mid-point: (1+3)//2 = 2
2*2 = 4 which is less than 8, so search in [3, 3]

Range is now: [3, 3]
Mid-point: 3
3*3 = 9 which is greater than 8, so search in [3, 2]

Since left > right, we stop and return `right`, which is 2.
```

This binary search approach is much more efficient, especially for large values of `x`.
Let's go ahead and implement the binary search approach for finding the integer square root in each of the provided languages. Here is the completed code:

### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer**: Let's discuss the problem presented. We have a table `Logs` with columns `id` and `num`, where `id` is the primary key and `num` contains the numbers. We need to find numbers that appear at least three times consecutively. How would you approach this problem initially?

**Interviewee**: To solve this problem, my initial thought would involve iterating over the `Logs` table, keeping track of each number and counting its consecutive appearances. If a number appears three or more times consecutively, I would store or flag it.

**Interviewer**: That makes sense. Could you please elaborate on a brute force approach to solve this scenario?

**Interviewee**: Certainly. A brute-force approach would involve:

1. Sorting the `Logs` table by the `id` to ensure we are examining the numbers in their inserted order.
2. Iterating through the sorted table and maintaining a counter for the current number's consecutive appearances.
3. When a number repeats, increment the counter. If a different number appears, reset the counter.
4. If the counter reaches three, add this number to the result set.

### Brute Force Approach

```sql
WITH ordered_logs AS (
    SELECT id, num
    FROM Logs
    ORDER BY id
),
grouped_logs AS (
    SELECT
        id, num,
        LAG(num, 1) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS prev_num1,
        LAG(num, 2) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS prev_num2
    FROM ordered_logs
)
SELECT DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM grouped_logs
WHERE num = prev_num1 AND num = prev_num2;
```

### Time and Space Complexity

**Time Complexity**: 
- Sorting the table: \(O(n \log n)\).
- Iterating through the table with window functions: \(O(n)\).

The overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting step.

**Space Complexity**: 
- We are using additional space for window functions and intermediate queries, which is \(O(n)\).

**Interviewer**: Your brute force approach is clear. Can we optimize this further?

**Interviewee**: Yes, we can optimize the solution by leveraging window functions in SQL to directly identify three consecutive occurrences without manually iterating or sorting the data ourselves.

### Optimized Approach

1. Use `LAG` functions to compare each number with its two preceding numbers in a single step.

### Optimized SQL Query

```sql
WITH consecutive_counts AS (
    SELECT
        num,
        LAG(num, 1) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS prev_num1,
        LAG(num, 2) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS prev_num2
    FROM Logs
)
SELECT DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM consecutive_counts
WHERE num = prev_num1 AND num = prev_num2;
```

### Visualization

```plaintext
+----+-----+------------+------------+
| id | num | prev_num1  | prev_num2  |
+----+-----+------------+------------+
| 1  | 1   | null       | null       |
| 2  | 1   | 1          | null       |
| 3  | 1   | 1          | 1          |  <-- matches three consecutive
| 4  | 2   | 1          | 1          |
| 5  | 1   | 2          | 1          |
| 6  | 2   | 1          | 2          |
| 7  | 2   | 2          | 1          |
| 8  | 2   | 2          | 2          | <-- matches three consecutive
+----+-----+------------+------------+
```

### Time and Space Complexity of Optimized Approach

**Time Complexity**: 
- It primarily relies on the window function, which runs in \(O(n)\).

**Space Complexity**: 
- The space complexity remains \(O(n)\) due to the use of intermediate tables for window functions.

**Interviewer**: Great job! The optimized approach is much more efficient. It efficiently uses SQL window functions to solve the problem without additional sorting or manual iteration. Thank you for the clear explanation and visualization.

### Closing Statement

In this discussion, we explored an SQL-based problem where we needed to find numbers that appear at least three times consecutively in a `Logs` table. We began by discussing a brute force approach and then moved forward to optimize the solution using SQL window functions like `LAG`. This allowed us to greatly simplify the logic and improve performance.

We provided optimized code snippets for various database systems, including MySQL, MS SQL Server, Oracle SQL, and PostgreSQL. Additionally, a Pandas-based solution was offered for handling data in Python. Each solution ensures efficient performance with a time complexity of \(O(n)\) and a space complexity of \(O(n)\). This discussion should prepare you to handle similar problems involving consecutive records and window functions in SQL.

Feel free to adapt these methodologies to other scenarios requiring detection of patterns within ordered data.

## Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

### Interviewer:
Let's work on a problem related to binary trees. Given the `root` of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, you need to return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom. Here's an example to give you a better idea:

**Example 1:**  
Input: `root = [1, 2, 3, null, 5, null, 4]`  
Output: `[1, 3, 4]`

Would you like to start by explaining your initial thoughts on how you might approach this problem?

### Interviewee:
Sure! To get the right side view of the binary tree, we need to focus on capturing the rightmost nodes visible at each level of the tree.

### Interviewer:
Alright. What's the most straightforward approach you can think of?

### Interviewee:
One brute-force approach could be to perform a level-order traversal (or breadth-first traverse) of the binary tree and at each level just keep track of the last node we visit since that last node would be the rightmost node visible for that level.

### Interviewer:
That sounds reasonable. Can you describe how you would implement the brute-force approach and its associated complexities?

### Interviewee:
Definitely!

1. **Algorithm:**
   - Use a queue to perform a level-order traversal of the tree.
   - For every level, add all nodes' values to a list.
   - At the end of each level's traversal, add the last node's value of that level to the result list as this node will be visible from the right side.
   
   Here's the step-by-step approach:
   1. Initialize an empty list `right_view` to store the right side view nodes.
   2. Use a queue to help with the breadth-first traversal. Start by adding the root to the queue.
   3. While the queue is not empty:
      - Note the number of nodes at the current level (size of the queue).
      - Iterate through each node at that level:
        - Pop the node from the queue.
        - If it's the last node of this level, add its value to `right_view`.
        - Add the node's children to the queue.
   4. Return `right_view`.

2. **Complexity:**
   - **Time Complexity:** Every node is visited once, so the time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree.
   - **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is determined by the queue's maximum size, which in the worst case is the largest number of nodes at any level during the traversal. This would also be \(O(n)\) in the worst case for a very unbalanced tree.

### Interviewer:
Okay. Can you think of a more optimized solution or a different data structure that might help?

### Interviewee:
The level-order traversal approach is already quite efficient for this problem. However, another variant could be using a Depth-First Search (DFS) with a priority of visiting the right children before the left children. This way, we can ensure that when we first encounter a node at a level, itâ€™s the rightmost node.

Here's an illustration of this approach:

```plaintext
          1
        /   \
       2     3
        \     \
         5     4
```

- Start with the root node (1).
- Traverse its right child (3) before its left (2), hence, we see 1 and 3 in the right view.
- Continue with the right-most children first until no more nodes to the right, which gives us nodes [1, 3, 4].

### Interviewer:
That sounds like a good plan. Could you implement this using a DFS approach and explain the code step by step?

### Interviewee:
Absolutely. Here's the Python implementation with DFS approach:

```python
# Define the TreeNode class to build the binary tree
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def rightSideView(root: TreeNode) -> List[int]:
    if not root:
        return []

    def dfs(node, level):
        if not node:
            return
        
        # If we are visiting this level for the first time
        if level == len(view):
            view.append(node.val)
        
        # Recur for right first, then left
        dfs(node.right, level + 1)
        dfs(node.left, level + 1)
    
    view = []
    dfs(root, 0)
    return view
```

### Explanation:
1. We define a nested helper function `dfs` that will perform depth-first search.
2. As we traverse the tree, we check if the current level is equal to the length of the view list. If it is, we add the node's value to the view list.
3. We start by visiting the right node first to ensure that the rightmost node is added to the view list first before any left nodes.
4. The function initializes an empty list `view` and starts the DFS traversal from the root.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) since each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.

This should cover the optimized way to get the right side view of a binary tree.

### Illustration:
Here's a visual representation of how the DFS approach works:

```plaintext
                1
              /   \
            2       3
             \       \
              5       4
              
Step-by-step DFS traversal (right child first):
1. Visit 1 (Level 0): view = [1]
2. Visit 3 (Level 1): view = [1, 3]
3. Visit 4 (Level 2): view = [1, 3, 4]
4. Backtrack and visit left child of 3 which is None (skip)
5. Backtrack to 1 and visit left child 2 (skip Level 1 as already captured)
6. Visit 5 (Level 2, captured already)
Final right view: [1, 3, 4]
```

### Closing Statement

We have successfully tackled the problem of determining the right side view of a binary tree. We began with a brute-force level-order traversal approach, evaluating its time and space complexities. Then, we optimized the solution using a depth-first search (DFS) approach, ensuring consistent time complexity of \(O(n)\) and space complexity of \(O(h)\) where \(n\) is the number of nodes and \(h\) is the height of the tree.

We implemented and discussed this solution in multiple programming languages including C++, Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Swift, Kotlin, Dart, Go, Ruby, Scala, Rust, Racket, and Erlang. Each implementation focused on correctly managing recursion and ensuring the most visible nodes are captured efficiently.

These exercises should help you understand different ways to work with tree structures efficiently and comprehend the importance of choosing the correct traversal method based on the problem's requirements.

### Similar Questions

To further practice and deepen your understanding, consider working on the following similar questions:

1. **Binary Tree Level Order Traversal**
   - Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).
   - Example: Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`, return `[[3], [9, 20], [15, 7]]`.

2. **Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal**
   - Given a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).
   - Example: Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`, return `[[3], [20, 9], [15, 7]]`.

3. **Leftmost Nodes of a Binary Tree**
   - Given a binary tree, return the values of the nodes that you see when the tree is looked at from the left side.
   - Example: Given binary tree `[1,2,3,null,5,null,4]`, return `[1, 2, 5]`.

4. **Sum of Left Leaves**
   - Find the sum of all left leaves in a given binary tree.
   - Example: Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`, the sum is `24` (9 + 15).

5. **Maximum Depth of a Binary Tree**
   - Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.
   - Example: Given binary tree `[3, 9, 20, null, null, 15, 7]`, return `3`.

Tackling these problems will not only enhance your skills in tree traversal techniques but also improve your problem-solving ability in various tree-related scenarios. Keep practicing and exploring different data structures to become proficient in solving complex coding challenges.

### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer:** Suppose we have an array that was originally sorted in ascending order but is then rotated between 1 and n times. You're given this rotated array and need to find the minimum element. How would you go about it?

**Interviewee:** Sure. It sounds like a classic problem of finding the minimum in a rotated sorted array. The key point here is that the array was sorted initially and then rotated. First, I think a good starting point is to discuss a brute force approach to find the minimum element.

**Interviewer:** That's a good starting point. Explain how you would do it using a brute force approach.

### Initial Thoughts on the Brute Force Approach

**Interviewee:** In a brute force approach, I would simply iterate through the array from start to end and keep track of the minimum element I encounter.

Here's a simple pseudocode for this approach:
```
def findMin(nums):
    min_element = nums[0]
    for num in nums:
        if num < min_element:
            min_element = num
    return min_element
```

**Interviewer:** That should work. What do you think is the time and space complexity of this approach?

**Interviewee:** The time complexity of this brute force approach is O(n), where n is the length of the array, because we need to traverse the entire array once. The space complexity is O(1) as we're only using a constant amount of extra space.

**Interviewer:** Good analysis. But the problem specifies we need an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time. Can we optimize this further?

**Interviewee:** Yes, we can use a binary search approach to achieve that. Given the array is rotated but still maintains a sorted structure, we can modify our binary search to efficiently find the minimum element.

### Optimized Solution Using Binary Search

**Interviewee:** Here’s the approach for the optimized solution:

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, at the beginning and end of the array, respectively.
2. Perform a binary search:
    - Calculate `mid` as the average of `left` and `right`.
    - Compare the middle element with the rightmost element.
    - If `mid` element is greater than the rightmost element, it implies the minimum element must be to the right of `mid`. Move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.
    - Otherwise, it implies the minimum element could be at `mid` or to the left of `mid`. Move the `right` pointer to `mid`.
3. When `left` and `right` converge, that will be where the minimum element resides.

Here’s the pseudocode:

```
def findMin(nums):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] > nums[right]:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
            
    return nums[left]
```

### Explanation with Diagram

Let’s visualize with an example array, `[4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]`:

1. Initial `left = 0`, `right = 6`.
2. `mid = (0 + 6) // 2 = 3`, nums[mid] = 7, which is greater than nums[right] = 2, so `left = mid + 1 = 4`.
3. Now, `left = 4`, `right = 6`, `mid = (4 + 6) // 2 = 5`, nums[mid] = 1, which is less than nums[right] = 2, so `right = mid = 5`.
4. Now, `left = 4`, `right = 5`, `mid = (4 + 5) // 2 = 4`, nums[mid] = 0, which is less than nums[right] = 1, so `right = mid = 4`.

Since `left` equals `right`, the loop ends, and the minimum element is at index `left`, which is `0`.

### Time and Space Complexity

**Interviewer:** That seems like a highly optimized solution. Could you discuss the complexity of this approach?

**Interviewee:**
- **Time Complexity:** The binary search approach runs in O(log n) time because it consistently halves the search space.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(1) because we are only using a constant amount of extra space.

Let’s draw this visually on a binary tree to depict how our algorithm works:
```
Initial:
[4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]
 L              M     R
Move Left Pointer:
            [0, 1, 2]
             L     M  R
Move Right Pointer:
             [0, 1]
              L  M R
Move Right Pointer:
              [0]
End of Search:
Left = Right pointing to minimum element 0
```

**Interviewer:** Excellent. You've demonstrated a solid understanding and optimization of the problem. This approach indeed meets the O(log n) requirement efficiently.

### Closing Statement

In our discussion, we have effectively addressed a classic problem: finding the minimum element in a rotated sorted array. We began with a brute force approach and analyzed its time and space complexities, demonstrating its simplicity but inefficiency for larger arrays. 

We then moved on to discussing and implementing a more efficient solution using binary search. This approach significantly optimizes the time complexity to O(log n) while maintaining a constant space complexity of O(1). By carefully modifying our binary search strategy to account for the array's rotation, we ensured a robust solution that works within the given constraints.

Moreover, we provided detailed implementations across various popular programming languages to cover a wide audience, following the specified method structures and ensuring consistency in our approach.

6. **Find K Closest Elements**: Given a sorted array, two integers `k` and `x`, find the `k` closest integers to `x` in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order. Your solution should have a time complexity of O(log n + k).

7. **Find Element in a Rotated Matrix**: Given an n x n matrix where each row and column is sorted in ascending order, write a function that returns whether the target value exists in the matrix.

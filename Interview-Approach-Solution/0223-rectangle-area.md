### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion:

**Interviewer:** 
Let's discuss a problem where you need to calculate the total area covered by two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane. Each rectangle is defined by its bottom-left and top-right corners. Could you explain how you would approach solving this problem?

**Interviewee:** 
Sure, let's start by understanding the given coordinates. For each rectangle, we have four coordinates: (ax1, ay1) for the bottom-left and (ax2, ay2) for the top-right of the first rectangle, and (bx1, by1) and (bx2, by2) for the second rectangle. The task is to calculate the combined area these two rectangles cover. 

**Interviewer:** 
That's correct. What would be your initial approach to solve this problem?

### Initial Thoughts on Brute Force Approach:

**Interviewee:**
For a brute force approach, I would follow these steps:

1. **Calculate individual areas**:
    - Area of the first rectangle: `(ax2 - ax1) * (ay2 - ay1)`
    - Area of the second rectangle: `(bx2 - bx1) * (by2 - by1)`
    
2. **Calculate the overlapping area**:
    - We need to check if the rectangles overlap. If they do, calculate the area of the overlapping region.
    - The overlap, if any, will itself be a rectangle defined by:
        - Left boundary: `max(ax1, bx1)`
        - Right boundary: `min(ax2, bx2)`
        - Bottom boundary: `max(ay1, by1)`
        - Top boundary: `min(ay2, by2)`
    
    - The overlapping area can be calculated only if the width and height of the overlapping region are positive:
        - width: `overlap_width = max(0, min(ax2, bx2) - max(ax1, bx1))`
        - height: `overlap_height = max(0, min(ay2, by2) - max(ay1, by1))`
    
    - Overlapping area: `overlap_area = overlap_width * overlap_height`

3. **Calculate the total area covered**:
    - Total covered area = Area of the first rectangle + Area of the second rectangle - Overlapping area

### Time and Space Complexity for Brute Force:

**Interviewer:** 
Great. What about the time and space complexity of this approach?

**Interviewee:** 
Letâ€™s evaluate that:

- **Time Complexity**: Since the calculation involves basic arithmetic operations, the time complexity is `O(1)`.
- **Space Complexity**: We are using a fixed amount of extra space for storing intermediate results such as the areas and overlap dimensions, so the space complexity is also `O(1)`.

**Interviewer:** 
Sounds good. Can you code that and also draw something to explain how these calculations work?

**Interviewee:** 
Sure, let me code this solution first.

```python
def computeArea(ax1, ay1, ax2, ay2, bx1, by1, bx2, by2):
    # Calculate individual areas
    area1 = (ax2 - ax1) * (ay2 - ay1)
    area2 = (bx2 - bx1) * (by2 - by1)
    
    # Calculate overlap dimensions
    overlap_width = max(0, min(ax2, bx2) - max(ax1, bx1))
    overlap_height = max(0, min(ay2, by2) - max(ay1, by1))
    
    # Overlapping area
    overlap_area = overlap_width * overlap_height
    
    # Total area covered by the two rectangles
    total_area = area1 + area2 - overlap_area
    
    return total_area
```

### Drawing Explanation:

Let me draw a diagram to explain this visually:

```plaintext
     ay2                             by2
      |                               |
      |                               |
    +------+ (ax2,ay2)           +------+
  ax1|      |                    |      | bx2
  --+------+------               +------+----
      |                         ax1|          bx1
      |__________ay1          by1|__________bx1

   Rectangle A: (ax1, ay1) to (ax2, ay2)
   Rectangle B: (bx1, by1) to (bx2, by2)

   Overlapping Area:
       If the rectangles overlap, the overlap region (left boundary, bottom boundary) to (right boundary, top boundary):
       left boundary = max(ax1, bx1)
       bottom boundary = max(ay1, by1)
       right boundary = min(ax2, bx2)
       top boundary = min(ay2, by2)
```

**Interviewer:**

        // Calculate overlap dimensions
        int overlap_width = std::max(0, std::min(ax2, bx2) - std::max(ax1, bx1));

### Interview Discussion

**Interviewer**: Great, let's discuss the task of writing a bash script to calculate the frequency of each word in a text file called `words.txt`. You can assume that the file contains only lowercase characters and space characters, with words separated by one or more whitespace characters. The goal is to output each word and its frequency, sorted in descending order of the frequency. How would you approach this problem?

**Interviewee**: To tackle this problem, I would start by discussing a brute force approach and then look into optimizing it. Let's break down the task:

1. **Step 1**: Read the content of the `words.txt` file.
2. **Step 2**: Split the content into words.
3. **Step 3**: Count the frequency of each word.
4. **Step 4**: Sort the words by frequency in descending order.
5. **Step 5**: Output the sorted list of words and their frequencies.

### Brute Force Approach

**Interviewee**: For a brute-force approach:
- I can use simple Unix tools to read and process the file content.

**Interviewer**: What Unix tools are you thinking about?

**Interviewee**: I am thinking of using tools like `cat`, `tr`, `sort`, `uniq`, and `awk`. Here’s how:

1. **Reading the content**:
   - Use `cat words.txt` to output the content of the file.

2. **Splitting and counting the words**:
   - Use `tr -s ' '` to squeeze multiple spaces into a single space, and `tr ' ' '\n'` to replace spaces with newlines.
   - Use `sort` to sort the words.
   - Use `uniq -c` to get the count of each unique word.

3. **Sorting by frequency**:
   - Use `sort -nr` to sort by numerical value in reverse order (descending).

4. **Formatting the output**:
   - Use `awk` to format the output as word followed by its frequency.

**Interviewer**: What about the time and space complexity of this approach?

**Interviewee**: Let’s break down the complexity:

- **Reading and splitting**: The `cat` and `tr` commands take O(N) time, where N is the number of characters in the file.
- **Sorting**: The `sort` command takes O(M log M) time, where M is the number of words, assuming Timsort or similar efficient algorithm is used.
- **Counting and re-sorting**: The `uniq -c` and `sort -nr` also take O(M) and O(M log M) time respectively.

The overall time complexity is O(N + M log M). The space complexity mainly involves storing the words and their frequencies, which is O(M).

### Optimized Approach

**Interviewee**: Considering optimization, the previous approach is quite efficient with the Unix tools provided. Bash one-liners utilizing pipes are generally well-optimized for these kinds of text processing tasks. Here’s the one-liner script that covers these steps efficiently:

```sh
cat words.txt | tr -s ' ' | tr ' ' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | awk '{print $2, $1}'
```

**Interviewer**: Could you break down the one-liner for clarity?

**Interviewee**: Of course!

1. `cat words.txt`: Outputs the content of the file.
2. `tr -s ' '`: Squeezes multiple spaces into a single space.
3. `tr ' ' '\n'`: Converts spaces into newlines, effectively splitting words.
4. `sort`: Sorts the words alphabetically.
5. `uniq -c`: Counts occurrences of each word.
6. `sort -nr`: Sorts the counts in descending numerical order.
7. `awk '{print $2, $1}'`: Reverses the order of the columns to print the word first, then the frequency.

### Diagram Illustration

Let's illustrate the steps using an example content of `words.txt` for a clearer understanding:

```
the day is sunny the the
the sunny is is
```

1. **Initial Input**:
   ```
   the day is sunny the the
   the sunny is is
   ```

2. **Squeezed spaces and split into lines**:
   ```
   the
   day
   is
   sunny
   the
   the
   the
   sunny
   is
   is
   ```

3. **Sorted words**:
   ```
   day
   is
   is
   is
   sunny
   sunny
   the
   the
   the
   the
   ```

4. **Counted words**:
   ```
     1 day
     3 is
     2 sunny
     4 the
   ```

5. **Sorted by frequency and formatted**:
   ```
   the 4
   is 3
   sunny 2
   day 1
   ```

**Interviewer**: That’s a clear and concise explanation! The optimized solution seems efficient and easy to understand. Thank you.

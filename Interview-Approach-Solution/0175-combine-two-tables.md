### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer:**

We have two tables, `Person` and `Address`. Your task is to write a query to list the first name, last name, city, and state for each person. If a person's address is not recorded in the `Address` table, their city and state fields should be `null`. Let's first discuss how you might approach this problem in a brute force way and analyse that.

**Interviewee:**

Okay. Let's first understand what we're dealing with. The `Person` table contains the personal information (personId, last name, first name), and the `Address` table contains the address information (addressId, personId, city, state). We need to merge these tables on `personId`. 

For a brute force approach, if we were just using basic SQL operations, I would think of:
1. Iterating through each entry in the `Person` table.
2. For each person, searching the `Address` table to find a matching `personId`.
3. If a match is found, we include the city and state from the `Address` table. 
4. If no match is found, we use `NULL` for city and state.

**Interviewer:**

That sounds like a plausible brute-force approach. How would you implement that in SQL, and what would you say about its time and space complexity?

**Interviewee:**

Sure. In SQL, this can be done using a `LEFT JOIN` operation:

```sql
SELECT p.firstName, p.lastName, a.city, a.state
FROM Person p
LEFT JOIN Address a
ON p.personId = a.personId;
```

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**
  A `LEFT JOIN` operation will scan both tables. Assuming `n` is the number of rows in the `Person` table and `m` is the number of rows in the `Address` table, a naive join may take up to O(n * m) in the worst case. However, with proper indexing on `personId`, it should average around O(n log m).

- **Space Complexity:**
  The space complexity is mainly O(n + m) for storing the results, as we are not using extra space apart from the original tables and the space required for the result set.

### Optimisation Discussion

**Interviewer:**

Good. Your understanding is clear, and the time complexity with indexing looks acceptable for most use cases. Can we optimise it more using any specific data structures?

**Interviewee:**

In terms of SQL, the use of `LEFT JOIN` itself is pretty optimal when indexing is properly applied to the `personId` fields in both tables. Given that SQL is set-based, it leverages efficient algorithms internally. However, the most we can do to optimise this query is:
- Ensure `personId` is indexed in both tables.
- Ensure the database statistics are up-to-date so that the SQL engine picks the most efficient execution plan.

**Drawing for Clarification:**

Let's illustrate the relationship and the `LEFT JOIN` operation:

```plaintext
Person Table (p):                  Address Table (a):

+----------+----------+-----------+   +-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
| personId | lastName | firstName |   | addressId | personId | city          | state      |
+----------+----------+-----------+   +-----------+----------+---------------+------------+
|    1     |   Wang   |   Allen   |   |     1     |    2     | New York City | New York   |
|    2     |   Alice  |    Bob    |   |     2     |    3     | Leetcode      | California |
+----------+----------+-----------+   +-----------+----------+---------------+------------+

LEFT JOIN on p.personId = a.personId

Output:
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
| firstName | lastName | city          | state    |
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
|   Allen   |   Wang   |     Null      |   Null   |
|    Bob    |  Alice   | New York City | New York |
+-----------+----------+---------------+----------+
```

The left outer join ensures that all records from `Person` are included in the results, and if there is no corresponding record in `Address`, the `city` and `state` are `null`.

**Interviewer:**

Excellent! You clearly explained the brute force approach, its complexity, and ways to optimize it. Your use of the drawing was helpful in understanding the join operation. Let's move on to the next scenario.
Sure, let's write the code for each language provided, and discuss the time and space complexity for each.

### MySQL

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT p.firstName, p.lastName, a.city, a.state
FROM Person p
LEFT JOIN Address a
ON p.personId = a.personId;
```

- **Time Complexity:** With proper indexing, the average complexity is O(n log m).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n + m) for storing the results.

### MS SQL Server

```mssql
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
SELECT p.firstName, p.lastName, a.city, a.state
FROM Person p
LEFT JOIN Address a
ON p.personId = a.personId;
```

- **Time Complexity:** Similar, O(n log m) with indexing.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n + m).

### Oracle SQL

```oraclesql
/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */
SELECT p.firstName, p.lastName, a.city, a.state
FROM Person p
LEFT JOIN Address a
ON p.personId = a.personId;
```

- **Time Complexity:** With indexing, it is O(n log m).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n + m).

### Pandas (Python)

```pythondata
import pandas as pd

def combine_two_tables(person: pd.DataFrame, address: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Perform a left join on the 'personId' column
    result = pd.merge(person, address, how='left', on='personId')
    
    # Select and rename the required columns
    result = result[['firstName', 'lastName', 'city', 'state']]
    
    return result
```

- **Time Complexity:** The merge operation in Pandas is optimized and should average around O(n log m).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n + m) for the merged DataFrame.

### PostgreSQL

```postgresql
-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below
SELECT p.firstName, p.lastName, a.city, a.state
FROM Person p
LEFT JOIN Address a
ON p.personId = a.personId;
```

- **Time Complexity:** Efficient with indexing, around O(n log m).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n + m).

These queries and code snippets correctly handle the task of combining the `Person` and `Address` tables as per the problem statement. Proper indexing is crucial for optimizing the time complexity in SQL database engines. In Python's Pandas, merge operations are also optimized but might not be as performant as dedicated SQL engines for very large datasets.


### Closing Statement

In this discussion, we tackled the problem of merging two tables (`Person` and `Address`) to list each person's first name, last name, city, and state, ensuring that missing address information results in `null` values. We explored the brute force approach and its implications on time and space complexity. By leveraging SQL `LEFT JOIN` operations and indexing on the `personId` column, we optimized our solution to be efficient in terms of both time and space. Additionally, we provided implementation examples across multiple SQL dialects and in Pandas for Python, demonstrating consistency and optimization across different environments.

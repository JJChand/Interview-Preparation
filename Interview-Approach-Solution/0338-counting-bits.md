### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer:** Let's discuss a problem where given an integer `n`, you need to return an array `ans` of length `n + 1` such that for each `i` (`0 <= i <= n`), `ans[i]` is the number of 1's in the binary representation of `i`. Do you understand the problem?

**Interviewee:** Yes, I understand. We need to return the count of 1's in the binary representation for each number from 0 to `n`.

**Interviewer:** Great. Let's start with an initial brute force approach. How would you proceed?

**Interviewee:** An initial brute force approach would be:
1. Iterate over each number from 0 to `n`.
2. For each number, convert it to its binary representation.
3. Count the number of 1's in this binary representation.
4. Store this count in the result array.

### Brute Force Approach

**Interviewer:** What would be the time and space complexity for this brute force approach?

**Interviewee:** 
- **Time Complexity:** For each number `i` from 0 to `n`, converting it to a binary representation takes up to `O(log i)` time, where `log i` is the number of bits in `i`. Counting the number of 1's takes `O(log i)` time. So, the overall time complexity will be the sum of `O(log i)` for `i` from 0 to `n`, which is `O(n log n)`.
- **Space Complexity:** We need an array of size `n + 1` to store the result, hence `O(n)`.

### Optimized Approach

**Interviewer:** Can you think of a way to optimize this to linear time `O(n)`?

**Interviewee:** Yes, we can use dynamic programming. The key observation is:
- The number of 1's in `i` can be thought of as reusing the result of a smaller number.
- Specifically, the count of 1's in `i` can be derived from `i >> 1` (i.e., `i` right-shifted by 1 bit) and the least significant bit of `i`.

**Interviewer:** Can you explain this further?

**Interviewee:** Sure. For any number `i`:
- When `i` is even, the number of 1's in `i` is the same as in `i >> 1` because the least significant bit is 0.
- When `i` is odd, the number of 1's in `i` is the same as in `i >> 1`, plus one more 1 for the least significant bit.

Using this, we can construct the `ans` array in linear time.

### Code Implementation

**Interviewer:** Could you write down the code for this approach?

**Interviewee:**
```python
def countBits(n):
    ans = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ans[i] = ans[i >> 1] + (i & 1)
    return ans

# Example Usage
print(countBits(2))  # Output: [0, 1, 1]
print(countBits(5))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2]
```

### Time and Space Complexity for Optimized Approach

**Interviewer:** What are the time and space complexities for this solution?

**Interviewee:** 
- **Time Complexity:** We iterate through each number from 1 to `n` exactly once, so itâ€™s `O(n)`.
- **Space Complexity:** We use an array `ans` of size `n + 1`, hence `O(n)`.

### Diagram to Explain the Concept

**Interviewer:** Can you draw a simple diagram to explain the optimized concept?

**Interviewee:**

```
Number (i)  Binary    ans[i >> 1]    i & 1    ans[i]    Explanation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
0           0         -              -        0         Base case
1           1         ans[0]        1        1     0 + 1
2           10        ans[1]          0         1     1 + 0
3           11        ans[1]        1        2     1 + 1
4           100       ans[2]        0        1     1 + 0
5           101        ans[2]         1       2     1 + 1

### Closing Statement

We've discussed and implemented a solution to the problem of counting the number of `1`s in the binary representation of numbers from `0` to `n`. We started with a brute force approach and then optimized it using a dynamic programming method which achieves linear time complexity `O(n)` and space complexity `O(n)`.

The optimized approach takes advantage of the relationship between the number of `1`s in `i` and `i >> 1`. By using this efficient solution, we can handle even large values of `n` up to `10^5` within reasonable computational limits.

### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer:** The problem you're dealing with involves finding a suitable starting gas station on a circular route such that you can complete the circuit exactly once. The arrays `gas` and `cost` represent the gas available at each station and the gas cost to travel to the next station, respectively. How would you approach this problem?

**Interviewee:** A good starting point is to consider a brute-force approach. I’ll start by attempting to start the journey from each gas station and simulate the journey to check if we can return to the initial station.

**Interviewer:** That sounds reasonable. Can you walk me through the brute-force approach and analyze its complexity?

**Interviewee:** Sure. For each station:

1. Start with an empty gas tank.
2. Attempt to complete a full circuit:
   - Add gas from the current station to the tank.
   - Subtract the cost to travel to the next station.
3. If the gas in the tank becomes negative at any point, this means the current starting station is not valid.
4. Repeat this for each starting station.

This leads to two nested loops:
- Outer loop runs through each station (O(n)).
- Inner loop attempts to complete the circuit starting from that station (O(n)).

The time complexity is O(n^2), which is not efficient for large input sizes (up to \(10^5\)).

**Interviewer:** Great! Now let's discuss optimizing this. Is there a more efficient way to solve this problem?

**Interviewee:** To optimize this, let's focus on some observations:
1. If the total gas is less than the total cost, it’s impossible to complete the circuit no matter where we start.
2. If we start at an invalid starting point and fail to complete the circuit, any station between this start and the failure point is also an invalid starting point.

**Interviewer:** Interesting. How would you leverage these observations in an optimized solution?

**Interviewee:** To implement a more efficient solution:
1. Calculate the total gas and total cost.
2. Check if completing the circuit is possible by comparing the total gas and total cost.
3. Use a single pass to find the valid start point:
   - Start from the first station and maintain a running sum of gas.
   - If at any point the running sum is negative, reset the starting station to the next station and reset the running sum.
   - The final candidate starting station after the loop will be the answer.

This ensures we traverse the arrays only once, making the time complexity O(n).

**Interviewer:** Sounds good! How about the space complexity?

**Interviewee:** Since we are using a constant amount of extra space, the space complexity is O(1).

**Interviewer:** Excellent! Could you illustrate that with a pseudo-code or diagram?

**Interviewee (Pseudo-code):**

```python
def canCompleteCircuit(gas, cost):
    if sum(gas) < sum(cost):
        return -1  # Not enough total gas to cover the total cost

    total_gas = 0
    current_gas = 0
    start_station = 0

    for i in range(len(gas)):
        total_gas += gas[i] - cost[i]
        current_gas += gas[i] - cost[i]

        # If current_gas drops below 0, reset starting point to next station
        if current_gas < 0:
            start_station = i + 1
            current_gas = 0

    return start_station if total_gas >= 0 else -1
```

**Illustration:**

```
Index Gas  Cost   Remaining Gas
 0     1    3       -2  (Start over)
 1     2    4       -2  (Start over)
 2     3    5       -2  (Start over)
 3     4    1       +3  (Candidate start)
 4     5    2       +6
 0     1    3       +4
 1     2    4       +2
 2     3    5       0
 3     4    1       3
```

**Conclusion:**
The optimized approach allows us to efficiently determine the starting gas station with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.
Certainly! Let's implement the optimized solution for each provided language. The logic includes checking if the circuit can be completed by tracking the total gas and cost and identifying an appropriate starting point.

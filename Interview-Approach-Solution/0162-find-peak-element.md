### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer**: Today, we'll be discussing a problem where you need to find a peak element in an array of integers. Have you come across peak elements before, or do you need me to explain?

**Interviewee**: Yes, I am familiar with the concept. A peak element is one that is strictly greater than its neighbors. Could you please provide more details about the problem requirements?

**Interviewer**: Sure. Given a 0-indexed integer array, you need to find a peak element and return its index. If there are multiple peak elements, you can return the index of any peak. Also, imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`, which means the elements outside the array are considered smaller. The key constraint is that your solution must run in O(log n) time.

**Interviewee**: Understood. So, the goal is to write an efficient algorithm to find a peak element.

### Initial Thoughts and Brute Force Approach

**Interviewee**: My first thought is to use a brute force approach. I can iterate through the array and check each element to see if it is greater than its neighbors. If it is, I'll return its index. This will involve checking conditions for each element, except the first and last, to avoid index out-of-bounds errors. Here’s the pseudocode for that:

```python
def findPeakElement(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if (i == 0 or nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) and (i == len(nums) - 1 or nums[i] > nums[i + 1]):
            return i
    return -1
```

**Interviewer**: That seems plausible. What do you think about the time and space complexity of this approach?

### Brute Force Time and Space Complexity

**Interviewee**: For the brute force approach:

- **Time Complexity**: Since we are iterating through the array once, the time complexity is O(n).
- **Space Complexity**: We are not using any extra space other than some variables, so the space complexity is O(1).

**Interviewer**: Great. But as per the problem constraints, we need to achieve O(log n) time complexity. How would you optimize your solution?

### Optimized Approach Using Binary Search

**Interviewee**: To achieve O(log n) time complexity, we can use a binary search approach. Here’s how it works:

1. **Initialize two pointers**: left and right to the start and end of the array.
2. **Find the middle element**: If the middle element is greater than its next element, then it means that there is a peak on the left side (including the mid element). Similarly, if the middle element is less than its next element, then the peak lies on the right side.
3. **Repeat** until the pointers converge.

Here’s the optimized algorithm in Python:

```python
def findPeakElement(nums):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]:
            right = mid  # move towards the left (mid could be a peak)
        else:
            left = mid + 1  # peak lies on the right
    
    return left  # or right, both are the same when left == right
```

### Optimized Time and Space Complexity

**Interviewee**: For this binary search approach:

- **Time Complexity**: O(log n), since we are halving the search space in each step.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), because we are using only a constant amount of extra space for pointers and variables.

### Illustration

Let's illustrate the binary search approach:

Consider an array `nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 4]`.

1. **Initial State**: left = 0, right = 6
2. **First Iteration**: mid = (0 + 6) // 2 = 3
   - nums[3] = 3, nums[4] = 5
   - Since nums[3] < nums[4], move left to mid + 1 => left = 4
3. **Second Iteration**: left = 4, right = 6, mid = (4 + 6) // 2 = 5
   - nums[5] = 6, nums[6] = 4
   - Since nums[5] > nums[6], move right to mid => right = 5
4. **Third Iteration**: left = 4, right = 5, mid = (4 + 5) // 2 = 4
   - nums[4] = 5, nums[5] = 6
   - Since nums[4] < nums[5], move left to mid + 1 => left = 5
5. **Convergence**: left = right = 5

So, index 5 is a peak element.

```plaintext
Left:  | 0 | 4 | 4 |
Right: | 6 | 6 | 5 |
Mid:   | 3 | 5 | 4 |
Moves: |R->M|R->M|L->M+1|
```

### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer**: Let's discuss the problem where we have `n` workers, and we are given their `quality` and `minimum wage expectation` in two arrays. We need to form a group of exactly `k` workers, paying them according to specific rules. Can you explain how we might approach solving this problem?

**Interviewee**: Sure! Since we need to pay workers based on their quality and respective minimum wage expectations, we should first consider the conditions we need to satisfy:
1. Each worker must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.
2. Workers' pay in the group must be proportionate to their quality.

**Interviewer**: Right. How do you think we should start solving this problem? What would be a brute force approach?

### Brute Force Approach

**Interviewee**: In a brute-force approach, we can evaluate all possible combinations of `k` workers. For each combination, we can determine the minimum coefficient that ensures each worker in the combination gets at least their minimum wage expectation. Using that coefficient, we can calculate the total cost to hire those workers. We'd keep track of the minimum total cost across all combinations.

**Interviewer**: Let's dig deeper. How would we calculate the coefficient and evaluate the cost?

**Interviewee**: For each combination of `k` workers:
1. Compute the ratio of the minimum wage to quality for each worker in the combination.
2. Take the maximum of these ratios, as this will be the scaling factor to ensure each worker's wage meets their expectation.
3. Using this scaling factor, compute the total wages for the group.
4. Track the minimum total wage over all combinations.

**Interviewer**: That makes sense. What would be the time and space complexity for this brute force approach?

### Time and Space Complexity of Brute Force

**Interviewee**: 
- **Time Complexity**: Generating all combinations of `k` workers from `n` will be `O(C(n, k))` where `C(n, k)` is the binomial coefficient `n choose k`. For each combination, we calculate the cost in `O(k)`. So the overall complexity would be very high, perhaps `O(C(n, k) * k)`.
  
- **Space Complexity**: We're storing each combination and the associated computed costs, so the space complexity is similarly high, mainly depending on how combinations are stored.

**Interviewer**: Indeed, the brute force approach is not feasible for large `n`. How can we optimize this problem?

### Optimizing with Priority Queue or Heap

**Interviewee**: To improve efficiency, we can use a priority queue (or max-heap):

1. **Sort Workers by Ratio**: First, we compute the ratio of wage to quality for each worker. Let's denote this ratio as `r = wage[i] / quality[i]`.
2. **Sort Workers**: Sort the workers based on these ratios.
3. **Use a Max-Heap to Maintain the Top `k` Qualities**: We'll use a max-heap to keep track of the smallest `k` workers based on their quality.
4. **Calculate the Cost**: As we iterate over the sorted list, we can calculate the total cost of the current group by summing the top `k` qualities and multiplying by the current ratio.

This allows us to always consider the least-costly group of `k` workers dynamically.

### Drawing Explanation

```plaintext
Step-by-step with Illustration:

1. Calculate ratio for each worker:
   Worker 0: quality = 10, wage = 70  => ratio = 70 / 10 = 7.0
   Worker 1: quality = 20, wage = 50  => ratio = 50 / 20 = 2.5
   Worker 2: quality = 5,  wage = 30  => ratio = 30 / 5  = 6.0

2. Sort workers by ratio:
   Sorted workers - [(1, 2.5), (2, 6.0), (0, 7.0)]
   Where each tuple is (worker index, ratio)

3. Use Max-Heap to hold top `k` smallest qualities:
   Max-heap after first k elements:
   For k = 2, heap contains: [10, 5]
   Total quality = 15
   Current min cost = 15 * max_ratio(6.0) = 90
   Moving further, replace if any lower quality found.

4. This keeps running and updating with least cost found during the iteration.
```

**Interviewer**: Great. Let's summarize the time and space complexity for this optimized approach.

### Time and Space Complexity for Optimized Approach

**Interviewee**: 
- **Time Complexity**: Sorting the workers by ratio takes `O(n log n)`. Maintaining the heap of size `k` for each worker takes `O(n log k)`, making it overall `O(n log n + n log k)`.
- **Space Complexity**: We use space for the heap, which is `O(k)`, and additional space for sorting, so overall `O(n)` space.

**Interviewer**: Perfect! This looks much more efficient. Thank you for walking through these steps.
Let's write the optimized code for each language provided. Here's the approach we'll take in all languages:

1. Calculate the ratio of wage to quality for each worker.
2. Sort the workers based on these ratios.
3. Use a max-heap to maintain the smallest total quality of the top `k` workers dynamically.
4. Calculate the minimum cost.

            workers.push_back({(double)wage[i] / quality[i], quality[i]});
        
        sort(workers.begin(), workers.end());
        priority_queue<int> maxHeap;  // max-heap to keep the largest k qualities
        int sumQuality = 0;
        double result = DBL_MAX;
        
        for (const auto& worker : workers) {
            maxHeap.push(worker.second);
            sumQuality += worker.second;
            if (maxHeap.size() > k) {

### Closing Statement

In this discussion, we've tackled a complex problem involving hiring workers while maintaining a proportional pay structure based on their quality and minimum wage expectations. By breaking down the problem, we first explored a brute-force approach, evaluated its infeasibility for large inputs due to high time complexity, and then moved on to an optimized solution using priority queues or heaps. We provided implementations of the optimized approach in various programming languages, ensuring that we adapt the logic appropriately to each language's unique features and syntax.

The problem highlighted crucial concepts in algorithm design and optimization, such as sorting, using heaps for dynamic programming, and maintaining running totals efficiently.

This kind of problem is essential for understanding how to handle constraints and optimize for performance in real-world applications, especially when working with large datasets.

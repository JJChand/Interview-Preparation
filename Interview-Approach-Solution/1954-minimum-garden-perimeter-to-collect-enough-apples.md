### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer**:
Let's discuss an interesting problem. You are given an infinite 2D grid with an apple tree planted at every integer coordinate. The tree at coordinate (i, j) has |i| + |j| apples. Your task is to find the minimum perimeter of a square plot centered at (0, 0) that includes or exceeds the given number of apples, `neededApples`. How would you approach this problem?

**Interviewee**:
First, let's clarify the problem. We need to find the smallest plot with a perimeter such that the number of apples within the plot is at least `neededApples`. The plot is centered at (0, 0) and is a square with sides of integer length.

**Interviewer**:
Exactly. How about beginning with a brute-force approach? 

### Initial Thoughts: Brute Force Approach

**Interviewee**:
The brute-force approach involves checking progressively larger squares centered at (0, 0) until we find one with a sufficient number of apples. Here's how we can achieve this:

1. Start with a small square (e.g., a 1x1 square).
2. Calculate the total number of apples inside this square.
3. If the number of apples is greater than or equal to `neededApples`, calculate and return the perimeter.
4. If not, increment the size of the square and repeat the steps until we find a satisfactory square.

The number of apples in each square can be summed by iterating over all the grid points within the square.

### Time and Space Complexity of Brute Force

**Interviewee**:
For the brute-force approach:

- **Time Complexity**: Let's say the side length of the square is `2k`. The total number of points we need to consider is `O(k^2)`, and for each square, we calculate the sum of apples in `O(k^2)` time. Hence, the worst-case time complexity could be exponential, `O(N^2)`, where N is the size we must search up to.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity would be `O(1)` if we don't store additional data and simply keep running sums.

**Interviewer**:
That seems too slow for large inputs, especially given the constraint where `neededApples` can be as large as \(10^{15}\). Can we optimize this solution?

**Interviewee**:
Definitely. Let's consider a more efficient strategy. We can leverage the symmetric properties and avoid recalculations by using a mathematical approach rather than iterating over points. 

### Optimized Approach

**Interviewee**:
To optimize, we can take advantage of the structure of the problem:

1. **Observation**: For each layer (with side length `2k`), the number of apples added to this layer is predictable.
2. **Helper Function**: A function to calculate the total number of apples within a certain distance from the center.
3. **Binary Search**: Instead of incrementing the side length linearly, we can use binary search to find the minimal side length that meets the condition.

Here's a sketch of a mathematical formula to count the apples and the optimized approach:

#### Counting Apples Mathematically

For a square with side length `2k + 1`:
- The layer at distance `k` around the center adds a certain fixed number of apples that can be calculated using the Manhattan distances of the points added in that layer.

```python
def count_apples(k):
    return 4 * (k * (k + 1) * (2 * k + 1)) // 3
```
We can use this function to binary search for the minimum `k` such that `count_apples(k) >= neededApples`.

### Binary Search Implementation

```python
def min_perimeter(neededApples: int) -> int:
    def count_apples(k):
        return 2 * k * (k + 1) * (2 * k + 1)

    low, high = 0, 10**6  # Set a large upper bound for binary search
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if count_apples(mid) >= neededApples:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid + 1
    
    side_length = low * 2 + 1
    perimeter = side_length * 2  
    return perimeter
```

### Time and Space Complexity of Optimized Approach

- **Time Complexity**: The binary search runs in `O(log N)` where N is a large bound, and the count function runs in constant `O(1)` time. Hence, the overall complexity is `O(log N)`.
- **Space Complexity**: Both the space complexity is `O(1)`, as we only use a few variables for the calculations.

### Visual Representation

**Interviewer**:
Can you please draw and explain how the squares are incremented?

**Interviewee**:
Sure, here's a diagrammatic explanation:

```
       3---3---3
       |   |   |
  2    3---2---3   2
       |   |   |
  1    2---1---2   1
       |   |   |
  0    3---2---3   0
       |   |   |
 -1    2---1---2  -1
       |   |   |
 -2    3---2---3  -2
       |   |   |
       3---3---3
            3
       
Each square layer adds more points symmetrically, and the number of apples is predictable.
```

**Interviewer**:

### Closing Statement

Great job in walking through this problem! We started by understanding the problem and devising a naive brute-force approach to get the solution. We then identified that the brute-force approach would be too slow for larger inputs and subsequently optimized it using mathematical observations and binary search. The optimized solution significantly improved the efficiency, reducing the complexity from `O(N^2)` to `O(log N)` in terms of time.

By implementing the solution in multiple programming languages, we explored how the approach can be adapted across different syntaxes and paradigms, demonstrating versatility and deep understanding of the optimized approach.

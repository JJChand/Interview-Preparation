**Interviewer:** Let's discuss a problem involving Pascal's Triangle. Given an integer `rowIndex`, we need to return the `rowIndex`<sup>th</sup> (0-indexed) row of Pascal's Triangle. 

**Interviewee:** Sure, let's start by understanding Pascal's Triangle. In Pascal's Triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The first few rows of Pascal's Triangle look like this:

```
Row 0:       [1]
Row 1:      [1, 1]
Row 2:     [1, 2, 1]
Row 3:    [1, 3, 3, 1]
Row 4:   [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
```

**Interviewer:** Exactly. Now, how would you approach solving this problem using a brute force method?

**Interviewee:** Sure. One way to solve this problem using a brute force method is to construct the entire Pascal's Triangle up to the given `rowIndex` and then extract the required row. 

Hereâ€™s an outline of the brute force approach:
1. Initialize the first row as `[1]`.
2. Iteratively compute each subsequent row by calculating the sum of the two numbers directly above it.
3. Continue this process until we reach the `rowIndex`th row.

**Interviewer:** Sounds reasonable. Could you discuss the time and space complexity of this brute force approach?

**Interviewee:** Of course.

- **Time Complexity:** The brute force approach requires us to construct all rows up to the `rowIndex`th row. Row \(i\) contains \(i + 1\) elements. Therefore, the total number of elements we need to compute is \(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (rowIndex + 1)\), which sums to \(\frac{rowIndex \times (rowIndex + 1)}{2}\). Therefore, the time complexity is \(O(rowIndex^2)\).

- **Space Complexity:** The space required to store the entire Pascal's Triangle up to `rowIndex` is also \(\frac{rowIndex^2}{2}\), but the space for the final result would only require an array of length `rowIndex + 1`. So, worst-case space complexity is \(O(rowIndex^2)\) if we keep all rows, but can be optimized to \(O(rowIndex)\) for the output array.

**Interviewer:** Let's talk about optimizing this algorithm using a more efficient data structure or technique. Could you think of a way to improve the space complexity?

**Interviewee:** Yes, we can optimize the space complexity. Instead of maintaining the entire Pascal's Triangle, we can notice that each row can actually be constructed from the previous row directly:

1. Start with the first row `[1]`.
2. For each subsequent row, we can generate it directly using the previous row. Each element in the current row can be derived as the sum of two elements from the previous row.
3. We utilize the same array to iteratively update the elements in place.

Here's a clearer example with `rowIndex = 4`:
```
Initial:        [1]
After 1st row:  [1, 1]
After 2nd row:  [1, 2, 1]
After 3rd row:  [1, 3, 3, 1]
After 4th row:  [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
```

This can be implemented efficiently by iterating from the end of the row to the beginning to update each cell based on the previous row.

**Interviewer:** Great! What would be the time and space complexity of this optimized approach?

**Interviewee:** The optimized approach has:
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(rowIndex^2)\) because we still need to compute all the elements in each row iteratively.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(rowIndex)\) because we only need an array of length `rowIndex + 1` to store the current row.

**Interviewer:** Excellent! Let's draw a visual representation to solidify this optimization.

**Interviewee:**
Certainly! Here's how we can visualize the process:

```
Initial Array: [1]

1st Row Update:
[1, 1]

2nd Row Update:
[1, 1, 0] => [1, 1+0, 1] => [1, 2, 1]

3rd Row Update:
[1, 2, 1, 0] => [1, 2, 1+0, 1] => [1, 2, 3, 1] => [1, 3, 3, 1]

4th Row Update:
[1, 3, 3, 1, 0] => [1, 3, 3, 1+0, 1] => [1, 3, 3, 4, 1] => [1, 3, 6, 4, 1] => [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
```

Each update step involves iterating from the end of the current list to the start, updating the elements in place. This ensures that we are only using \(O(rowIndex)\) space while still constructing the correct row iteratively.

**Interviewer:** That's perfect! Thank you for explaining both the brute force and the optimized approaches, along with complexities and clear visual representation.

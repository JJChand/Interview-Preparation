### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer**: Let's discuss this problem where we need to find employees who have the highest salary in each department. How would you approach this initially?

**Interviewee**: Sure, I'll start with a brute force approach. We can first identify the highest salary for each department, and then fetch the employees who have that salary. Once we clear that approach and its limitations, we can discuss optimizations.

### Initial Thought about Brute Force Approach

**Interviewee**: For the brute force approach:

1. **Identify distinct departments**: Iterate through the `Employee` table and collect all distinct department IDs.
2. **Find maximum salary for each department**: For each department, iterate through the `Employee` table again to find the highest salary in that department.
3. **Retrieve employees with that salary**: For each department and its highest salary, iterate through the `Employee` table a third time to gather employees who have that salary.

### Time and Space Complexity of Brute Force Approach

**Time Complexity**: 

- Identifying distinct departments takes O(n).
- Finding the highest salary per department: Suppose there are `d` departments, for each department, it takes another O(n). Therefore, it takes O(n * d).
- Retrieving employees with the highest salary per department again takes O(n * d).

Total time complexity is roughly O(n * d).

**Space Complexity**:
- We need space to store up to `d` departments and their corresponding highest salaries and employees, which would be roughly O(d).

The brute force approach is feasible but not optimal. We are iterating through the `Employee` table multiple times which can be inefficient, especially for large datasets.

### Optimized Approach

**Interviewee**: To optimize, we can use SQL more efficiently. We can use:
1. A subquery to determine the maximum salary for each department.
2. A join operation to fetch all employees with the determined maximum salary for each department.

```sql
SELECT Department.name AS Department, Employee.name AS Employee, Employee.salary AS Salary
FROM Employee
JOIN (
    SELECT departmentId, MAX(salary) as max_salary
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY departmentId
) AS MaxSalaries
ON Employee.departmentId = MaxSalaries.departmentId AND Employee.salary = MaxSalaries.max_salary
JOIN Department
ON Employee.departmentId = Department.id
```

### Explanation with Drawing

Here is a step-by-step breakdown and visual representation:

1. **Subquery**: Retrieves the maximum salary for each department.
   
   ```
   +--------------+------------+
   | departmentId | max_salary |
   +--------------+------------+
   | 1            | 90000      |
   | 2            | 80000      |
   +--------------+------------+
   ```
   
   The subquery groups the records by `departmentId` and finds the maximum salary for each group.

2. **Join Operations**: Matching employees with their respective maximum salaries.

   ```
   INNER JOIN results of subquery on Employee.departmentId = MaxSalaries.departmentId 
   AND Employee.salary = MaxSalaries.max_salary

   +----+-------+--------+--------------+
   | id | name  | salary | departmentId |
   +----+-------+--------+--------------+
   | 2  | Jim   | 90000  | 1            |
   | 5  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
   | 3  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
   +----+-------+--------+--------------+
   ```

3. **Final Join**: Attaching department names to the employee data.

   ```
   +------------+----------+--------+
   | Department | Employee | Salary |
   +------------+----------+--------+
   | IT         | Jim      | 90000  |
   | IT         | Max      | 90000  |
   | Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
   +------------+----------+--------+
   ```

### Time and Space Complexity of Optimized Approach

**Time Complexity**:

- Subquery to find max salary: O(n), since it scans the table once and groups by `departmentId`.
- Joining subquery result with the original table: O(n), as it matches and filters records simultaneously.
- Final join operation: O(n), as it matches department names with existing results.

Overall time complexity is O(n).

**Space Complexity**:
- Space for storing results of subquery and joins: O(d) and O(n) respectively, which is more optimal.

This optimized approach significantly reduces unnecessary iterations and leverages the database management system's optimized operations.
Sure, let's write the optimized solution for each of the mentioned languages, with the necessary method or function wrappers and a brief explanation of their time and space complexity.

### MySQL

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT Department.name AS Department, Employee.name AS Employee, Employee.salary AS Salary
FROM Employee
JOIN (
    SELECT departmentId, MAX(salary) as max_salary
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY departmentId
) AS MaxSalaries
ON Employee.departmentId = MaxSalaries.departmentId AND Employee.salary = MaxSalaries.max_salary
JOIN Department
ON Employee.departmentId = Department.id
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of records in the `Employee` table.

**Space Complexity**: O(d), where d is the number of distinct departments.

### MS SQL Server

```mssql
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
SELECT Department.name AS Department, Employee.name AS Employee, Employee.salary AS Salary
FROM Employee
JOIN (
    SELECT departmentId, MAX(salary) as max_salary
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY departmentId
) AS MaxSalaries
ON Employee.departmentId = MaxSalaries.departmentId AND Employee.salary = MaxSalaries.max_salary
JOIN Department
ON Employee.departmentId = Department.id
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of records in the `Employee` table.

**Space Complexity**: O(d), where d is the number of distinct departments.

### Oracle

```oraclesql
/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */
SELECT Department.name AS Department, Employee.name AS Employee, Employee.salary AS Salary
FROM Employee
JOIN (
    SELECT departmentId, MAX(salary) as max_salary
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY departmentId
) AS MaxSalaries
ON Employee.departmentId = MaxSalaries.departmentId AND Employee.salary = MaxSalaries.max_salary
JOIN Department
ON Employee.departmentId = Department.id
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of records in the `Employee` table.

**Space Complexity**: O(d), where d is the number of distinct departments.

### Pandas (Python)

```pythondata
import pandas as pd

def department_highest_salary(employee: pd.DataFrame, department: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Find the maximum salary for each department
    max_salaries = employee.groupby('departmentId')['salary'].max().reset_index()
    max_salaries = max_salaries.rename(columns={'salary': 'max_salary'})
    
    # Merge the max salaries back to the employee table
    merged = pd.merge(employee, max_salaries, on='departmentId')
    
    # Filter employees with the max salary in their department
    result = merged[merged['salary'] == merged['max_salary']]
    
    # Merge with department to get department names
    result = pd.merge(result, department, left_on='departmentId', right_on='id')
    
    # Select required columns and rename them
    result = result[['name_y', 'name_x', 'salary']]
    result.columns = ['Department', 'Employee', 'Salary']
    
    return result
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of records in the `Employee` table.

**Space Complexity**: O(d), where d is the number of distinct departments and additional space required for intermediate DataFrames in memory.

    GROUP BY departmentId
) AS MaxSalaries
ON Employee.departmentId = MaxSalaries.departmentId AND Employee.salary = MaxSalaries.max_salary
JOIN Department
ON Employee.departmentId = Department.id
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of records in the `Employee` table.

### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer:** Let's start by discussing the problem. You are given a table named `Person` with `id` and `email` columns. You need to delete all duplicate emails but keep one unique email with the smallest id. Can you walk me through your understanding of the problem?

**Interviewee:** Sure! The task is to ensure that for every unique email, only one entry remains in the table, and this entry should have the smallest `id` among the duplicates. Essentially, we need to delete the rows that have duplicate emails with higher `id` values.

**Interviewer:** Good. How would you approach this problem with a brute force method?

**Interviewee:** For a brute force approach, I would:
1. Identify all duplicate emails.
2. For each duplicate email, keep the row with the smallest `id` and delete the other rows.
3. This would involve scanning through the table and comparing emails to find duplicates.
 
**Interviewer:** That sounds correct. Can you elaborate on the time and space complexity of this brute force approach?

**Interviewee:** Of course. To identify duplicates:
- I would need to scan the table, resulting in an O(n^2) complexity where n is the number of rows, due to the comparison between each pair.
- For space complexity, if we use auxiliary data structures to keep track of seen emails, it would take O(n) space in the worst-case scenario.

### Brute Force SQL Implementation

```sql
DELETE FROM Person
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT MIN(id)
    FROM Person
    GROUP BY email
);
```

### Complexity Analysis of Brute Force Approach

- **Time Complexity:** The query uses a subquery with a `GROUP BY` clause which scans the table O(n) times, and the `DELETE` statement internally might scan the table again for deletions, making it approximately O(n).
- **Space Complexity:** The space used by the `GROUP BY` clause can be O(n) due to the potentially large result set.

### Optimizing the Solution

**Interviewer:** Can you suggest a more optimized approach or use a more efficient data structure?

**Interviewee:** Yes, instead of using a nested subquery, we can use a common table expression (CTE) which simplifies understanding and might be more efficient depending on the SQL engine's optimization.

### Optimized SQL Using CTE

```sql
WITH UniqueEmails AS (
    SELECT MIN(id) as min_id
    FROM Person
    GROUP BY email
)

DELETE FROM Person
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT min_id
    FROM UniqueEmails
);
```

### Explanation with Diagram

Let's take an example to visualize the steps.

1. **Original Table**:
    ```
    +----+------------------+
    | id | email            |
    +----+------------------+
    | 1  | john@example.com |
    | 2  | bob@example.com  |
    | 3  | john@example.com |
    +----+------------------+
    ```

2. **Identifying Unique Emails** (through CTE):
    ```
    +--------+
    | min_id |
    +--------+
    | 1      |
    | 2      |
    +--------+
    ```
    Here, `1` is the smallest `id` for `john@example.com` and `2` for `bob@example.com`.

3. **Deleting Duplicates**:
    - Delete rows where `id NOT IN (1, 2)`.

4. **Resulting Table**:
    ```
    +----+------------------+
    | id | email            |
    +----+------------------+
    | 1  | john@example.com |
    | 2  | bob@example.com  |
    +----+------------------+
    ```
    The second entry for `john@example.com` (with `id = 3`) is deleted.

### Complexity Analysis of Optimized Approach

- **Time Complexity:** The CTE and subsequent `DELETE` operation scales better, typically O(n) due to efficient grouped operations and unique constraints.
- **Space Complexity:** Similar O(n) to store the temporary results of the CTE.

**Interviewer:** This looks great! You've managed to come up with an efficient solution. Is there anything else we need to consider?

**Interviewee:** One consideration is the SQL engine used, as performance can vary. Moreover, proper indexing on the `email` column can further optimize the performance of `GROUP BY` operations.
Sure, let's wrap the solutions in the provided method/statement shells while adding comments about time and space complexity.

### MySQL

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

-- Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(n)

WITH UniqueEmails AS (
    SELECT MIN(id) as min_id
    FROM Person
    GROUP BY email
)

DELETE FROM Person
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT min_id
    FROM UniqueEmails
);
```

### MS SQL Server

```mssql
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */

/* 
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
*/

WITH UniqueEmails AS (
    SELECT MIN(id) as min_id
    FROM Person
    GROUP BY email
)

DELETE FROM Person
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT min_id
    FROM UniqueEmails
);
```

### Oracle SQL

```oraclesql
/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */

/* 
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
*/

WITH UniqueEmails AS (
    SELECT MIN(id) as min_id
    FROM Person
    GROUP BY email
)

DELETE FROM Person
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT min_id
    FROM UniqueEmails
);
```

### Pandas

```python
import pandas as pd

def delete_duplicate_emails(person: pd.DataFrame) -> None:
    # Time Complexity: O(n)
    # Space Complexity: O(n)
    
    # Identify the duplicated emails keeping the smallest id
    unique_min_ids = person.groupby('email')['id'].min().values
    
    # Filter rows where id is not in the unique_min_ids array
    person.drop(person[~person['id'].isin(unique_min_ids)].index, inplace=True)
```

### PostgreSQL

```postgresql
-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below

-- Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(n)

WITH UniqueEmails AS (
    SELECT MIN(id) as min_id
    FROM Person
    GROUP BY email
)

DELETE FROM Person
WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT min_id
    FROM UniqueEmails
);
```

Each code snippet is designed to ensure that only unique emails with the smallest `id` are kept in the `Person` table, using the optimal approach discussed. The time complexity is generally O(n) due to the operations on the set of emails, and space complexity is also O(n) due to the temporary storage of intermediate results (`UniqueEmails`).


### Closing Statement

**Interviewer:** Great job! You've demonstrated a clear understanding of the problem by successfully optimizing the solution to delete duplicate emails while keeping the one with the smallest `id`. You've provided efficient solutions in SQL as well as in Pandas, which are both optimized in terms of time and space complexity. You also articulated the complexities involved and how to manage them effectively with appropriate data structures and techniques.

**Interviewee:** Thank you! This was an interesting problem to solve, and I'm glad I could come up with an optimized approach that works across different environments. Understanding the nuances of SQL optimization and the power of Pandas in data manipulation was very insightful.

**Interviewer:** Well done. Practicing such problems will further enhance your ability to handle data manipulation tasks efficiently. Keep up the good work!

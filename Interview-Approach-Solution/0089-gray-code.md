**Interviewer:** Could you please explain the given question on generating an n-bit Gray code sequence?

**Interviewee:** Sure! The task is to generate a sequence of `2^n` integers which satisfy the following conditions:
1. Every integer in the sequence is in the range `[0, 2^n - 1]`.
2. The sequence starts with the integer `0`.
3. Each integer in the sequence appears no more than once.
4. The binary representation of every pair of adjacent integers differs by exactly one bit.
5. The binary representation of the first and last integer in the sequence also differs by exactly one bit.

**Interviewer:** Great, that’s correct. Now, how would you approach this problem using a brute force method first?

**Interviewee:** One brute force approach is to generate all the integers in the range `[0, 2^n - 1]`, then attempt to arrange them such that the conditions are met. For each possible permutation, we would check if the sequence satisfies the adjacent differences by exactly one bit and if the first and last element differ by one bit. However, this method can be highly inefficient since there are `2^n!` permutations to consider, which grows very rapidly with `n`.

**Interviewer:** Right, that approach will indeed be very slow. Could you tell me about the time and space complexity of this brute force method?

**Interviewee:** Sure. The time complexity of this brute force approach is `O((2^n)!)` because we would need to generate and check all the permutations of `2^n` integers. The space complexity would be `O(2^n)` for storing each permutation.

**Interviewer:** That’s quite inefficient. Can you think of a more efficient way to solve this problem?

**Interviewee:** Yes, a more efficient way is to use a known method for generating Gray codes. One simple way is to use the formula `G(i) = i ^ (i >> 1)` for `i` in the range `[0, 2^n - 1]`. This formula directly generates the i-th Gray code.

**Interviewer:** Interesting. How does this method improve efficiency?

**Interviewee:** Using this formula, we can generate the Gray code sequence in linear time and space. Specifically:
- **Time Complexity:** O(2^n), because we generate each element of the sequence exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(2^n), because we store the entire sequence.

Here's a simple diagram to visualize the Gray code generation for `n=2`:

```
i   : 00  01  10  11
G(i): 00  01  11  10 (Gray Code obtained using G(i) = i ^ (i >> 1))
```

As we see:
- `00` -> `01` (differ by one bit)
- `01` -> `11` (differ by one bit)
- `11` -> `10` (differ by one bit)
- `10` -> `00` (differ by one bit, connecting last to first)

So, for `n=2`, the sequence `[0, 1, 3, 2]` is generated correctly.

**Interviewer:** Excellent! Could you now provide a simple code snippet to generate the Gray code sequence for any given `n`?

**Interviewee:** Certainly. Here's a Python function to generate the Gray code sequence using the formula `G(i) = i ^ (i >> 1)`:

```python
def grayCode(n):
    return [i ^ (i >> 1) for i in range(2 ** n)]

# Example usage:
print(grayCode(2)) # Output: [0, 1, 3, 2]
print(grayCode(1)) # Output: [0, 1]
```

This function generates the desired sequence efficiently by directly computing each term using the given formula.

### Closing Statement:

Great job! We've thoroughly discussed how to generate an n-bit Gray code sequence, starting with an initial brute force approach and then optimizing it using a more efficient formula-based method. We explored the implementation of this method across various programming languages, each with linear time and space complexity, `O(2^n)`. This approach ensures that we can generate the desired Gray code sequence efficiently, making it practical even for larger values of `n`.

Understanding Gray code is beneficial, especially in contexts such as error correction, digital communication, and hardware design, where precise bit manipulation is crucial. The optimized formula `G(i) = i ^ (i >> 1)` allows us to generate these sequences efficiently and keeps the computational overhead minimal.

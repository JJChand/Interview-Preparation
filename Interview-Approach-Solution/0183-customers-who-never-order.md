### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer:** Let's go through a SQL problem. You are given two tables: `Customers` and `Orders`. The `Customers` table lists customer details with their IDs, and the `Orders` table mentions order details including which customer made the order. You need to find all customers who never ordered anything. How would you approach this problem?

**Interviewee:** Sure, let’s start by examining the structure of the tables:
- `Customers(id, name)`
- `Orders(id, customerId)` with `customerId` being a foreign key referencing `Customers(id)`

**Interviewer:** Exactly. How would you approach solving this problem at first?

**Interviewee:** To solve this problem, we could use a brute force approach. Essentially, what we need to do is:
1. For each customer in the `Customers` table, check if there are any entries in the `Orders` table that match the customer's ID.
2. If there are no matching entries, that customer did not place any orders, and should be included in the result.

### Brute Force Approach

**Interviewee:** Let's consider the brute force approach. We would join these tables and find customers who don't appear in the `Orders` table.

We can do a **left join** on `Customers` and `Orders` and then filter out the customers whose `customerId` in the `Orders` table is `NULL`.

Here is the SQL code to implement this approach:
```sql
SELECT c.name AS Customers
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o
ON c.id = o.customerId
WHERE o.customerId IS NULL;
```

**Interviewer:** That's correct. Can you explain the time and space complexity of this approach?

**Interviewee:** Sure.

**Time Complexity:**
- A full join operation has a time complexity proportional to the product of the number of rows in the two tables. So for `Customers` with `N` rows and `Orders` with `M` rows, it can be O(N * M) in the worst case.
- After the join, filtering records where `customerId` is `NULL` is O(N) because we need to scan through at most `N` rows.

**Space Complexity:**
- The space complexity is O(N + M) because we need to store the intermediate join results, which combine both rows and can be as large as the sum of rows in `Customers` and `Orders`.

### Optimized Approach

**Interviewer:** Can you think of a more optimized way to achieve this?

**Interviewee:** Yes. An efficient solution can be achieved by using a **subquery** or **NOT IN**/ **NOT EXISTS** clause to filter out the customers who do have orders directly.

Using `NOT EXISTS`, the optimized query would look like:
```sql
SELECT name AS Customers
FROM Customers c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM Orders o
  WHERE c.id = o.customerId
);
```

Using `LEFT JOIN` with `NULL` checking:
```sql
SELECT c.name AS Customers
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o
ON c.id = o.customerId
WHERE o.customerId IS NULL;
```

Using `NOT IN`:
```sql
SELECT name AS Customers
FROM Customers
WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT customerId FROM Orders);
```

**Interviewer:** That makes sense. Let's draw something to clearly explain the optimized approach using `LEFT JOIN`:

### Drawing Explanation

```
Customers Table                    Orders Table
+----+-------+                     +----+------------+
| id | name  |                     | id | customerId |
+----+-------+                     +----+------------+
| 1  | Joe   |                     | 1  | 3          |
| 2  | Henry |                     | 2  | 1          |
| 3  | Sam   |                     +----+------------+
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+

LEFT JOIN Result:
+----+-------+------------+
| id | name  | customerId |
+----+-------+------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 1          |
| 2  | Henry | NULL       |
| 3  | Sam   | 3          |
| 4  | Max   | NULL       |
+----+-------+------------+

Filtered Result:
+-------+
| name  |
+-------+
| Henry |
| Max   |
+-------+
```

**Interviewer:** Excellent. You’ve covered the brute force solution, discussed its complexity, and then optimized it. Well done!
Sure, I'll provide the code snippets for each of the specified languages, including their respective time and space complexities.

### MySQL

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT name AS Customers
FROM Customers c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM Orders o
  WHERE c.id = o.customerId
);

-- Time Complexity: O(N + M)
-- Space Complexity: O(1)
```

### MS SQL Server

```mssql
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
SELECT name AS Customers
FROM Customers c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM Orders o
  WHERE c.id = o.customerId
);

-- Time Complexity: O(N + M)
-- Space Complexity: O(1)
```

### Oracle SQL

```oraclesql
/* Write your PL/SQL query statement below */
SELECT name AS Customers
FROM Customers c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM Orders o
  WHERE c.id = o.customerId
);

-- Time Complexity: O(N + M)
-- Space Complexity: O(1)
```

### Pandas (Python)

```pythondata
import pandas as pd

def find_customers(customers: pd.DataFrame, orders: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    merged_df = pd.merge(customers, orders, left_on='id', right_on='customerId', how='left')
    no_orders_df = merged_df[merged_df['customerId'].isna()]
    return no_orders_df[['name']].rename(columns={'name': 'Customers'})

# Time Complexity: O(N + M)
# Space Complexity: O(N + M)
```

### PostgreSQL

```postgresql
-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below
SELECT name AS Customers
FROM Customers c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM Orders o
  WHERE c.id = o.customerId
);

-- Time Complexity: O(N + M)
-- Space Complexity: O(1)
```

All these queries and the Pandas code optimize the original problem efficiently by utilizing a `NOT EXISTS` clause or its equivalent, ensuring that customers without orders are selected properly. The provided time and space complexities reflect the efficiency of these optimized solutions.


### Closing Statement

In this discussion, we tackled a common SQL problem of identifying customers who never placed an order by leveraging the `NOT EXISTS` clause, which efficiently handles the requirements while ensuring optimal performance. We explored potential brute force approaches, highlighting their inefficiencies, and then moved towards optimized solutions using SQL constructs that are both readable and performant. We also implemented these solutions across various SQL dialects, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL, and MS SQL Server, and demonstrated a Pandas solution in Python for data manipulation enthusiasts. These constructs help to address relational data queries efficiently and are fundamental in database management and data analysis.

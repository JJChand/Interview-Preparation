### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion:

**Interviewer:** Let's start with the problem. You are given an array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money. The goal is to return the fewest number of coins needed to make up that amount. If it's not possible to make that amount, return `-1`. How would you approach solving this problem?

**Interviewee:** The problem appears to be a classic example of a coin change problem which can be approached using dynamic programming. However, let me first explain a brute-force approach to get a grasp of the problem.

**Interviewer:** Sure, let’s discuss the brute-force approach first.

**Interviewee:** 
The brute-force approach involves trying all possible combinations of coins to find the minimum number of coins that sum up to the given amount. 

1. We can start by recursively subtracting each coin value from the amount and keep count of the coins used.
2. This would be repeated for each possible combination until we either match the amount or cannot proceed further because the remaining amount cannot be matched.
3. The base cases would be:
   - If the amount is `0`, return `0` because no coins are needed.
   - If the amount is negative, return `-1` indicating that it's not possible with the given combination.

Let’s discuss an example to understand the brute-force approach better.

### Example

For `coins = [1,2,5]` and `amount = 11`:
- Start with amount `11`:
  - Try `1`, now we need to make `10`.
  - Try `2`, now we need to make `9`.
  - Try `5`, now we need to make `6`.

This recursion can form a tree-like structure, and we track the minimum path length (coin count) that sums up to `amount`.

### Time and Space Complexity of Brute-force Approach

The brute-force approach is not efficient:
- **Time Complexity:** Exponential, `O(S^n)` where `S` is the amount and `n` is the number of coins.
- **Space Complexity:** Exponential because of the recursive stack.

**Interviewer:** Yes, the brute-force approach is naive and not efficient. Let's try to optimize it. Can we use a more efficient data structure or technique?

**Interviewee:** Absolutely, we can use dynamic programming to optimize our solution. This approach not only improves the time complexity but also simplifies our code.

### Optimized Approach using Dynamic Programming

1. **Using an Array (DP table)**:
   - We initialize an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of coins required to make amount `i`.
   - Initialize `dp[0] = 0` because zero coins are needed to make amount `0`.
   - For other indices, initialize `dp[i]` to `amount + 1` (a value larger than the largest possible answer).
   
2. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - For each amount from `1` to `amount`, check for each coin in the array:
     - If a coin value is less than or equal to the amount, we update `dp[amount]` as
       ```cpp
       dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
       ```
   - If `dp[amount]` remains `amount + 1`, return `-1` because it means the amount cannot be formed with the given coins.
   - Otherwise, return `dp[amount]` which will be the minimum number of coins.

### Example Execution Flow:
- **Initialization:**
  ```
  amount = 11
  coins = [1, 2, 5]
  dp = [0, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12]
  ```
- **Filling DP Table:**
  - For each coin:
    - `coin = 1`: Update dp array.
      ```
      dp = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
      ```
    - `coin = 2`: Update dp array.
      ```
      dp = [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6]
      ```
    - `coin = 5`: Update dp array.
      ```
      dp = [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3]
      ```

In the end, the fewest number of coins for amount `11` is `3` (from dp array).

### Time and Space Complexity of Optimized DP Approach
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * amount)`, where `n` is the number of coins. This is because we iterate through the coins for each amount.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(amount)`, because we only store amounts up to the target amount.

Here’s a visual to show how the dp array gets updated:
```
      ________________________________________
     |  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 | ...
     |____|____|____|____|____|____|____|____|
dp = |  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 | ...

After considering coin `2`:
     |  0 |  1 |  1 |  2 |  2 |  3 |  3 |  4 | ...

After considering coin `5`:
     |  0 |  1 |  1 |  2 |  2 |  1 |  2 |  2 | ...
```

**Interviewer:** Great, that was a thorough explanation! The dynamic programming approach is indeed more efficient. Thank you!
Sure! Below are the implementations for the coin change problem in the given languages. We'll first summarize the time and space complexities for the optimized dynamic programming approach.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * amount)`, where `n` is the number of coins and `amount` is the target amount.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(amount)`, as we use a single array of size `amount + 1`.

### Closing Statement

We've discussed the coin change problem, which involves finding the minimum number of coins needed to make up a given amount using coins of specified denominations. We started with a brute-force approach and highlighted its inefficiencies. Then, we transitioned to a dynamic programming solution, optimizing both time and space complexities. This optimized approach significantly reduces computational overhead by storing intermediate results and reusing them.

### Discussion Between Interviewer and Interviewee

**Interviewer:** Today, we're going to tackle a problem related to climbing stairs. Here's the problem statement:

You're climbing a staircase that takes `n` steps to reach the top. Each time, you can either climb 1 step or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Consider the following examples:

1. If `n = 2`, there are two ways to climb to the top:
    - 1 step + 1 step
    - 2 steps

2. If `n = 3`, there are three ways to climb to the top:
    - 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
    - 1 step + 2 steps
    - 2 steps + 1 step

The constraints are `1 <= n <= 45`.

**Interviewer:** How would you approach solving this problem?

**Interviewee:** To start, I'd think about the brute force approach. For every step, we have two choices: take one step or take two steps. We could recursively explore each possibility until we reach the top. 

### Initial Thought: Brute Force Approach

**Interviewee:** For a brute force solution, we can use recursion. At each step, we either climb 1 step or 2 steps. We'll continue this until we either exactly reach `n` (which counts as one way) or exceed `n` (which is not a valid way).

Here's a basic idea of the recursive function:
- If the current step count equals `n`, then we've found a valid way to reach the top.
- If the current step count exceeds `n`, it's invalid.
- Otherwise, we move to the next step either by taking 1 step or 2 steps and sum the results.

**Interviewer:** That makes sense. What would the time and space complexity be for this brute force method?

**Interviewee:** The time complexity would be exponential, `O(2^n)`, because each step has two possible choices, leading to a binary tree of height `n`. Space complexity would be `O(n)` because of the recursion stack in the worst case.

**Interviewer:** Can we do better in terms of efficiency?

**Interviewee:** Yes, we can optimize this using dynamic programming. Instead of recalculating the number of ways for the same steps multiple times, we can store and reuse them.

### Optimized Approach: Dynamic Programming

**Interviewee:** We can use a dynamic programming approach or even recognize that this resembles the Fibonacci sequence. Let's look at the DP approach first.

The idea is to build a table `dp[]` where `dp[i]` represents the number of distinct ways to reach step `i`.

1. Initialize `dp[0] = 1` (one way to stay at the start).
2. Initialize `dp[1] = 1` (one way to reach the first step).
3. For each step `i` from 2 to `n`:
   - `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`

This recurrence relation ensures that at each step, the number of ways to get there is the sum of the ways to get to the two previous steps.

#### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` because we iterate through the steps once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` if we use an array, but can be reduced to `O(1)` if we use only two variables to keep track of previous steps.

Here's a visual representation of the DP array if `n = 5`:

**n = 5**

```
dp[0] = 1
dp[1] = 1
dp[2] = 2  (1+1, 2)
dp[3] = 3  (1+1+1, 1+2, 2+1)
dp[4] = 5  (1+1+1+1, 1+1+2, 1+2+1, 2+1+1, 2+2)
dp[5] = 8  (1+1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+2, 1+1+2+1, 1+2+1+1, 2+1+1+1, 1+2+2, 2+1+2, 2+2+1)
```

### Optimized Code

```python
def climbStairs(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    prev1, prev2 = 1, 1
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        current = prev1 + prev2
        prev1, prev2 = prev2, current
    return prev2

# Example usage:
print(climbStairs(2))  # Output: 2
print(climbStairs(3))  # Output: 3
```

**Interviewer:** That looks solid! You've clearly improved the efficiency, reducing both time and space complexity. Thank you for the detailed explanation.

**Interviewee:** Thank you!

### Closing Statement

In this discussion, we explored a classic dynamic programming problem â€” the climbing stairs problem. This problem demonstrates a fundamental concept in dynamic programming by providing multiple ways to solve a problem optimally using previously computed results to avoid redundant calculations. Starting from a brute force approach, we moved to an optimized solution with a time complexity of `O(n)` and space complexity of `O(1)`, which significantly improves the efficiency of our solution.

We also implemented the optimized solution across several programming languages to provide a comprehensive guide for developers of different backgrounds. This exercise not only strengthens algorithmic thinking but also provides a practical understanding of converting high-level solutions into code in various languages.

### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer**: Let's discuss a problem where you need to implement a calendar that allows booking of events, but we need to ensure that adding a new event won't cause a triple booking. Could you explain how you would start thinking about this problem?

**Interviewee**: Sure. First, let me clarify: a triple booking means that three events overlap at some point in time. The event intervals are given as [start, end) where start is inclusive and end is exclusive. We'll need to maintain the events in such a way that we can check for overlapping conditions efficiently.

### Initial Brute Force Approach

**Interviewee**: To begin with, a brute force approach would be to keep a list of all intervals and, for every new event, check for overlaps with all existing events. Specifically:
1. We iterate through each previously booked event.
2. For every new booking interval [start, end), we check it against all existing bookings.
3. We further check if this overlap would cause a triple booking.

The brute-force approach could look something like this:

1. Maintain a list `bookings` of all booked intervals.
2. Book an event only if it doesn't cause a triple overlap by checking against all other bookings.

**Interviewer**: It makes sense. Let's talk about the complexity.

### Complexity Analysis of Brute Force Approach

**Interviewee**: The time complexity of the brute force approach is:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) for each booking operation because for each new event, we may need to compare it with all previous bookings to check for potential triple bookings.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the booked intervals.

**Interviewer**: That is indeed computationally expensive, especially when considering the constraint of `at most 1000` calls to book.

### Optimizing the Approach

**Interviewee**: Let's optimize it. One way to think about optimizations here is to use data structures that help us efficiently manage intervals:
1. We can use a list to keep track of single bookings.
2. A second list can be used to track double bookings.

**Interviewer**: Interesting. How would you implement this?

**Interviewee**: For each new booking request, we can check:
1. First, whether adding this booking to the current double bookings would cause a triple booking.
2. If not, then we update the single bookings and double bookings:
   - Check against current single bookings whether it would form a double booking.
   - Update the double bookings list with the intervals that overlap between the new booking and booked intervals.

Hereâ€™s a skeleton of how the solution might look:

```python
class MyCalendarTwo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.bookings = []
        self.double_bookings = []

    def book(self, start: int, end: int) -> bool:
        # Check if the new booking intersects with any double bookings
        for db_start, db_end in self.double_bookings:
            if start < db_end and end > db_start:
                return False
        
        # Record new double bookings
        for b_start, b_end in self.bookings:
            if start < b_end and end > b_start:
                self.double_bookings.append((max(start, b_start), min(end, b_end)))
        
        # Finally, record the booking
        self.bookings.append((start, end))
        return True
```

### Complexity of Optimized Approach

**Interviewer**: How does this affect the complexity?

**Interviewee**: 
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) for each booking operation since we need to check the overlaps with the current bookings and double bookings.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) because we store intervals for both bookings and double bookings.

**Interviewer**: This seems much more efficient and should work well within the constraints given. Thank you for the clear explanation.

### Visual Aid

To understand better, let's sketch out the concept of adding booking intervals:

```
|---------|         (Existing booking 1)
      |---------|   (Existing booking 2 causing a double booking with existing 1)
|-------------|     (New booking causing triple booking with previous 2)
     X
```

Here "X" indicates the overlap that would cause a triple booking, which is what our method is designed to prevent. 

By maintaining a list of current booking and double bookings, we ensure that any new booking does not create a new interval that overlaps more than two times.
Let's implement the described solution in the specified languages with appropriate time and space complexity considerations.

### C++

```cpp
class MyCalendarTwo {
public:
    vector<pair<int, int>> bookings;
    vector<pair<int, int>> double_bookings;

    MyCalendarTwo() {}

    bool book(int start, int end) {
        for (auto& [db_start, db_end] : double_bookings) {
            if (start < db_end && end > db_start)
                return false;
        }

        for (auto& [b_start, b_end] : bookings) {
            if (start < b_end && end > b_start)
                double_bookings.push_back({max(start, b_start), min(end, b_end)});
        }

        bookings.push_back({start, end});
        return true;
    }

### Closing Statement

This problem required implementing a calendar that ensures no triple bookings occur when scheduling new events. By using efficient data structures to track single and double bookings, we optimized the solution from a brute-force approach to more efficient approaches with manageable time and space complexities. The final solution was effectively implemented across various programming languages, each maintaining the underlying logic and structure to ensure a consistent approach to managing booking intervals.

The complexity considerations:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) for each booking operation because we need to check and update the bookings and double bookings lists.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the booked intervals and double-booked intervals.

The comprehensive discussion and step-by-step implementation in different languages demonstrate how an algorithm can be consistently translated and optimized for use in multiple environments. This approach is critical for ensuring that solutions are robust, scalable, and maintainable across different platforms.

### Similar Questions

Here are some questions that are similar in nature and will help reinforce the concepts of interval handling and booking systems:

1. **My Calendar I**:
    ```markdown
    Implement a calendar where you can add and check if a new event can be booked without causing a conflict with existing events (no overlap allowed).
    ```

2. **My Calendar III**:
    ```markdown
    Implement a calendar that can handle multiple bookings and return the maximum number of events that are booked simultaneously at any point in time.
    ```

3. **Merge Intervals**:
    ```markdown
    Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals into a single interval.
    ```

4. **Interval List Intersections**:
    ```markdown
    Given two lists of intervals, return their intersection.
    ```

5. **Meeting Rooms II**:
    ```markdown
    Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times, return the minimum number of conference rooms required.
    ```

6. **Non-overlapping Intervals**:
    ```markdown
    Find the minimum number of intervals that can be removed to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
    ```

7. **Insert Interval**:
    ```markdown
    Insert a new interval into a list of non-overlapping intervals and merge if necessary.
    ```

These questions build on the concepts of managing intervals, checking for overlaps, and optimizing resource allocation, all of which are crucial in many real-world applications such as booking systems, scheduling, and resource management.

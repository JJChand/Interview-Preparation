### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

#### Interviewer:
Let's work on a string manipulation problem today. The task is to reverse the order of words in a given input string `s`. A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters, words are separated by spaces, and the reversed string should only have a single space between each word with no leading or trailing spaces.

Let's consider an example:

- If the input is "the sky is blue", the output should be "blue is sky the".
- For "  hello world  ", the output should be "world hello".

How would you approach solving this problem? Let's start by discussing a brute force approach.

#### Interviewee:
Sure. To solve this problem using a brute force approach, I can follow these steps:

1. **Split the String**: Split the input string `s` into a list of words using space as a delimiter.
2. **Reverse the List**: Reverse the list of words.
3. **Join the Words**: Join the reversed list of words with a single space as a delimiter.

Let's break it down with an example:
- Input: "  hello  world  "
- After Splitting: `['hello', 'world']`
- After Reversing: `['world', 'hello']`
- After Joining: "world hello"

Would this approach work for you?

#### Interviewer:
That sounds good. Let's discuss the time and space complexity of this brute force approach.

#### Interviewee:
Sure.

**Time Complexity**:
- Splitting the string into words takes O(N) time, where N is the length of the string.
- Reversing the list of words would take O(W) time, where W is the number of words.
- Joining the words to form the resultant string will take O(N) time.
- So, the overall time complexity is O(N).

**Space Complexity**:
- Splitting the string into words results in an extra space proportional to the input size, which is O(N).
- Storing the reversed order of words also takes O(N) space.
- The final joined string will also be O(N).

Therefore, the space complexity is O(N).

#### Interviewer:
Great. Can you optimize this approach? Specifically, can you improve the space complexity?

#### Interviewee:
Yes, we can optimize the approach by modifying the string in-place if the string is mutable. But most languages treat strings as immutable. Let's consider another optimization using a more efficient data structure like a stack to handle the operations:

1. **Trim and Split**: Remove leading and trailing spaces and split the input string by spaces into words.
2. **Use a Stack**: Push each word onto a stack.
3. **Pop from Stack**: Pop words from the stack and join them with a single space.

This approach leverages the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) behavior of stacks to achieve the reverse order directly.

**Optimized Approach**: Using a Stack
1. **Trim and Split**: Remove extra spaces and split into words.
2. **Use Stack**: Push words onto the stack.
3. **Pop and Join**: Pop words and join them to form the reversed string.

#### Stack Optimized Approach Analysis:
**Time Complexity**:
- Trimming and splitting the string will be O(N).
- Pushing words onto the stack is O(W).
- Popping words and joining them to form the result is O(N).
- The overall time complexity remains O(N).

**Space Complexity**:
- The primary additional space is the stack to store the words, which is O(W), where W is the number of words. In the worst-case scenario, O(W) is equivalent to O(N), thus making space complexity O(N). Although we are using a stack, it essentially just holds references to the same words we've split out.

#### Drawing Explanation:

Here's a simple visual representation of the optimized approach:

```
Input:           "   the  sky  is    blue   "
After Trim/Split: [ "the", "sky", "is", "blue" ]

Step with Stack:
- Initial Stack: []
- Push "the" -> Stack: ["the"]
- Push "sky" -> Stack: ["the", "sky"]
- Push "is" -> Stack: ["the", "sky", "is"]
- Push "blue" -> Stack: ["the", "sky", "is", "blue"]

Popping from Stack results in reverse order:
- Join words popped from stack -> "blue is sky the"
```

This ensures all operations maintain O(N) complexity, but with thoughtful use of extra space through the stack (still O(N) in the worst-case though).
Certainly! Below are the `reverseWords` function implementations for each provided language. Each implementation ensures we adhere to the constraints and efficiently reverse the words while maintaining optimal space and time complexity.

        s = s.substr(start, end - start + 1);
        
        // Split words
        vector<string> words;
        string word;
        istringstream ss(s); // using stringstream to split by spaces
        while (ss >> word) {
            words.push_back(word);
        }

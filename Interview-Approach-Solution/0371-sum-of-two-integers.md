### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer:** Let's discuss a coding problem: You are given two integers `a` and `b`, and you need to return their sum without using the operators `+` and `-`. How would you approach this problem?

**Interviewee:** Interesting problem. To summarize, we need to find the sum of two integers `a` and `b` without directly using addition or subtraction. I think a good place to start might be with some bitwise operations. 

**Interviewer:** That's right! Do you have any initial brute force ideas for how you might solve this?

**Interviewee:** Well, we can't use `a + b`, so I initially thought about using loops to simulate addition, but I'm not sure how efficient that would be. For instance, we could use a loop to increment one value while decrementing the other until one of them is zero, but this seems quite inefficient.

**Interviewer:** Right, looping could work, but it will indeed be inefficient. Can you think of a different approach, perhaps involving bitwise operations?

**Interviewee:** Bitwise operations? Okay, let me think. We know that addition involves carrying over bits. Perhaps we can use bitwise AND to find carry bits, and bitwise XOR to find the sum without carry. Combining these iteratively might help. Here's what I'm thinking:

1. Use XOR to get the sum without carry.
2. Use AND to get the carry and shift it left by one.
3. Repeat this process until there's no carry.

**Interviewer:** That sounds promising! Could you explain the time and space complexity of your approach?

### Brute Force Approach and Complexity Analysis

**Interviewee:**

**Brute Force Approach:**
If we use a loop to manually add or subtract:
```python
def add(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a += 1
        b -= 1
    return a
```

This brute force loop runs until `b` reaches zero, either increasing or decreasing `a`.

**Time Complexity:** O(max(a, b)) - This is because we increment/decrement in each iteration.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) - We're only using a few extra variables.

**Interviewer:** Exactly. However, this is inefficient for large values of `a` and `b`. Let's optimize using bitwise operations.

### Optimized Approach with Bitwise Operations

**Interviewee:** Let's go through the optimized version:

```python
def get_sum(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        carry = a & b
        a = a ^ b
        b = carry << 1
    return a
```

**Explanation:**
1. `a ^ b` gives the sum without carry.
2. `a & b` gives the carry bits.
3. `carry << 1` shifts carry to the correct position.
4. Repeat until there is no carry left.

**Interviewer:** That's great! What's the complexity now?

**Interviewee:**

**Time Complexity:** O(1) - Since we are dealing with fixed-width integers (e.g., 32-bit), the loop runs a constant number of times.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) - We're only using a few extra variables.

**Interviewer:** Can you illustrate this with an example?

**Interviewee:** Sure, letâ€™s use `a = 1` and `b = 2`:

1. Initial:
   - `a = 1 (01 in binary)`
   - `b = 2 (10 in binary)`

   ```plaintext
   a      = 01
   b      = 10
   a ^ b  = 11  (3 in decimal, represents the sum without carry)
   a & b  = 00  (no carry)
   ```

2. Carry:
   - `carry = (a & b) << 1 = 00 << 1 = 0`

   ```plaintext
   a      = 11
   b      = 00
   ```

   Since `b` is now zero, we stop and `a` holds the final sum which is `3`.

Here's an illustration for better understanding:
```
       01
     + 10
     ----
       11 (XOR result, intermediate sum)
```
And because there's no carry in this case, the answer is simply `11` in binary, which is `3` in decimal.

**Interviewer:** Excellent explanation and well done implementing the optimized solution!

    else
      get_sum(a ^^^ b, (a &&& b) <<< 1)
    end
  end
end
```

In all these implementations, the time complexity is \(O(1)\) because the number of iterations will be limited by the size of the integer (e.g., typically 32 iterations for 32-bit integers). The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as well because only a fixed amount of extra space is used regardless of the size of the input integers.

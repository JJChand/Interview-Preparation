### Interviewer and Interviewee Discussion

**Interviewer:** Let's discuss the problem statement first. You are given a sorted array of integers and a target sum. Your goal is to find two numbers in the array that add up to that target sum. The array is 1-indexed and you need to return the indices of these two numbers as an integer array. You also have certain constraints like using only constant extra space. How would you start tackling this problem?

**Interviewee:** A good starting point would be to understand the constraints and guarantees provided by the problem. Since the array is sorted and there's exactly one solution, we can consider a brute force approach first to get the basics clear and then optimize from there.

**Interviewer:** Alright, let's start with discussing the brute force approach.

### Brute Force Approach

**Interviewee:** The brute force approach would involve checking each pair of numbers to see if they sum up to the target. Essentially, we would:

1. Iterate through each element `numbers[i]` of the array.
2. For each element `numbers[i]`, iterate through the subsequent elements `numbers[j]` where `j > i`.
3. Check if `numbers[i] + numbers[j] == target`.
4. If true, return the indices `[i+1, j+1]` because the array is 1-indexed.

**Interviewer:** Great, what would be the time and space complexity of this approach?

**Interviewee:** The time complexity would be \(O(n^2)\), since we're using two nested loops to iterate through all possible pairs. The space complexity would be \(O(1)\) because no extra data structures are used aside from a couple of variables.

### Example of Brute Force
Let's look at an example for clarity:

#### Given:
`numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15]`
`target = 9`

Process:
1. \(2 + 7 = 9\): Indices are `[1, 2]`. Return `[1, 2]`.

This correctly identifies the pair that sums to the target.

### Optimizing the Approach

**Interviewer:** The brute force method works but it's not efficient. Can you think of a more efficient way to solve this problem?

**Interviewee:** Yes, since the array is already sorted, we can use the two-pointer technique to optimize the solution. Here's the plan:

1. Initialize two pointers: `left` at the beginning (`0`) and `right` at the end (`numbers.length - 1`).
2. Calculate the sum of the numbers at these two pointers.
3. If the sum is equal to the target, return the 1-indexed positions.
4. If the sum is less than the target, move the `left` pointer to the right to increase the sum.
5. If the sum is greater than the target, move the `right` pointer to the left to decrease the sum.

By doing this, we ensure that we only pass through the array once (\(O(n)\)), and since we are only using pointers, the space complexity is also \(O(1)\).

### Drawing Explanation

Let's illustrate this with an example:

#### Example:
`numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15]`
`target = 9`

Initial Pointers:
- `left` = 0 (pointing to `2`)
- `right` = 3 (pointing to `15`)

Process:
1. \( numbers[ left ] + numbers[ right ] = 2 + 15 = 17 \)
   - Since 17 > 9, move the `right` pointer to the left.

2. \( numbers[ left ] + numbers[ right ] = 2 + 11 = 13 \)
   - Since 13 > 9, move the `right` pointer to the left.

3. \( numbers[ left ] + numbers[ right ] = 2 + 7 = 9 \)
   - Since 9 == 9, return `[left + 1, right + 1]` â†’ `[1, 2]`

This technique is efficient and straightforward once you understand the properties of a sorted array.

```plaintext
Initial:
numbers = [2, 3, 4, 7, 11, 15]
             ^                   ^
           left               right

Iterations:
1. left = 0, right = 5: 2 + 15 = 17 > 9, move right to 4
   numbers = [2, 3, 4, 7, 11, 15]
             ^                ^
           left            right

2. left = 0, right = 4: 2 + 11 = 13 > 9, move right to 3
   numbers = [2, 3, 4, 7, 11, 15]
             ^             ^
           left         right

3. left = 0, right = 3: 2 + 7 = 9, found target
   return [1, 2]
```

### Closing Statement

**Interviewer:** We have thoroughly discussed the problem where you are given a sorted array and a target sum, and you need to find two indices such that the numbers at those indices add up to the target. You have presented and implemented both a brute force approach and an optimized solution using the two-pointer technique. The two-pointer method leverages the sorted nature of the array to achieve an efficient \(O(n)\) time complexity while maintaining a constant \(O(1)\) space complexity, which meets the problem's constraints.

Your implementations in multiple languages clearly demonstrate your understanding of the algorithm and its application in different programming paradigms. Well done!
